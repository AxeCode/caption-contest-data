74,8,0,I don't think either party will ever nominate one of us.
87,20,4,For some reason I always look fat in those home videos.
73,8,0,Again watching Animal Planeck ?
75,11,1,"This ""spoonful of sugar"" advice is a crock."
80,12,2,While you're watching Nature I need nurture.
69,3,0,That's all you do all day is watch The National Geographic Channel!
80,13,3,"Really, a couch potato? I thought you were above all that!"
92,17,6,They never forget because they don't have our vision and rely on low hanging fruit.
87,16,5,Perhaps we should have mounted the TV on a tree.
91,18,5,"When I was your age, son, I never would have dreamed of a giraffe president."
73,7,1,"A new TV, with a larger screen? Just lean in."
89,18,4,"Actually, I prefer a vertical format."
73,3,3,we have to keep searching. there must be someone we can vote for.
69,3,2,At least we're vegan.
118,49,14,Ruminating again?
71,9,1,Reticulated room for one
102,33,9,"I don't care if we live in Detroit, I find your enthusiasm for the Lions distasteful..."
69,3,0,It's 11 pm. Do you know where your tower is?
1157,1617,2007,Sorry I'm late. I hit every traffic light coming home.
84,14,4,"Room’s too small, no tree leaves from Room Service, can’t access the bathroom- was seeing Lion King worth it?"
76,11,2,Turn off Animal Planet and do your homework.
66,3,1,"You've been necking with the girl next door again, haven't you?"
75,7,2,"Do we get ""The Necking Channel""?"
97,19,10,I like him for some reason. Maybe it's the orange hair.
111,22,18,Neckflix again?
149,48,37,After millions of years of natural selection this is what you want to do all day?
88,24,4,"Gladys, you said if we moved to the city, we’d ""live"" a wild life, not watch it."
62,2,0,"Not to be a snob, but frankly watching the lowbrow fare on there is difficult for me."
82,16,3,Beats the stifling savannah heat and that survival of the fittest run around.
81,15,2,I can't believe that reporter is putting her neck out to interview an extremist-hyena.
82,14,4,The political conventions are getting hard to swallow.
105,23,14,Apparently you ordered the wide screen instead of the tall screen.
69,2,0,I just can't watch regular TV any more.
75,7,1,Do I have to duck?
80,17,1,"When it's over, then can we neck?"
92,18,7,I don't care to watch Animal Planet when I've lived it all day.
84,12,5,Not 'American Giraffiti' again.
73,9,1,I think you need to cut back on binge-watching 'Wild Kingdom' reruns.
82,10,3,"Honey, I'm up for anything tonight."
82,13,2,"Oh, hon, we really should have bought the three-seater or the sectional."
85,12,5,"Live! From Great Neck, New York! It's Saturday Neck Live!"
96,26,8,Why don't you stream something off Zulu?
70,3,1,Better get your feet off the sofa. The rental rules are pretty picky.
71,3,1,Is this what you do all day watch TV?
91,29,4,"Phil, you said you were going to clean the gutters."
103,31,10,"Cleaning the gutters was easy, but I still can't figure out how to drag the trash cans to the curb."
67,5,0,Sorry for sticking my neck in..........
78,11,1,I've heard too much TV can shorten your neck length
73,12,0,I told you it wasn't wall-mounted.
101,26,11,It's pointless. I told you we need a tall screen not a wide screen.
81,15,3,"Really, no necking tonight?"
87,23,4,Let me guess: Lion Week?
69,1,1,I liked it better when we could see all the earrings and rings on those short-necked people.
89,22,3,"Do you want to ""Neckflix and chill""?"
81,12,2,I am here to get giraffe off the couch!
93,30,4,Would you like to go to the zoo and see the humans today?
72,5,0,I told you cork flooring would be too thick
84,20,3,"As in the wild, their pride will be our downfall."
71,6,0,"I don't care how long you watch that nature sow, the lions are still out there."
82,6,4,The Fire Department wants to know who called them about a monkey stuck in a tree.

83,16,4,The elephants are really emabarassing themselves this time around.
132,48,34,I hope you're not ordering more turtlenecks from QVC
76,5,2,Why do you get the good couch?
72,6,1,Housewives of New Jersey is utterly unsuitable for well brought-up young ladies.
81,17,2,Animal Planet is so idealistic.
127,44,21,I didn't know Noah's ark would be so luxurious.
92,24,5,Of course I know how it ends. The wildebeast gets eaten and Marlin Perkins sells insurance...
77,11,2,"No, honey, I'd rather not spend the whole weekend binge-watching Neckflix?"
81,19,1,How about I mount it on the ceiling?
71,6,0,"Uhh, didn't we agree this prescription was for medical use only?"
86,14,4,"I'm gonna go grab a couple of long necks, want anything?"
76,13,0,Aren't these reality shows on Wild Kingdom great!
93,10,8,Anything good on the baobab tube?
79,9,3,"He says he will fight for all citizens - Latino citizens, women, orphans, LGBTQ citizens, the elderly citizens.....But will he fight for giraffes, that's what I want to know !"
83,23,1,"Don't be scared, he just plays a lion on TV"
98,42,5,Don't be like that. I was hungry. The shade in the back yard will eventually grow back.
171,61,53,If Trump wins we're moving back to Africa.
81,13,3,"Elephants, donkeys, why not a giraffe?"
83,22,0,The Travel Channel again? We've been to the Serengeti.
66,2,0,Feeling anything yet?
98,21,8,Change the screen to the portrait mode!
80,14,2,"""Real Housewives""? I know you like low-hanging fruit, but come on."
69,3,1,"May as well be a clam, because you don't seem to use your neck anymore."
73,11,0,Clarissa stop watching Trump!His Son shot one of us back in The Old Country
103,27,11,"Your mother is on the phone, and she says that the lions are stalking her again."
68,2,0,"If you keep watching that tv, your tongue will turn red."
89,25,4,I'm not watching Madagascar again.
89,12,7,If you scoot over we could neck.
103,34,9,I told you we should've gone with wall mounted.
98,32,7,"I know you're not supposed to be on your feet too much, but the entire 14 months?!"
75,9,2,"'Neckflix and Chill' doesn't mean the whole weekend."""
70,3,0,Honey ... I know you think DIY is self-help and IT IS! But it means YOU do it yourself not THEY do it and you watch!
108,37,12,Just because I can see the tv from anywhere doesn't mean you can hog the couch
67,3,0,You sat through two conventions/
91,19,6,It's official - I'm the tallest thing on the block without TRUMP on me.

132,56,25,CSI: Africa? Really?
99,15,7,Didn't I tell you you'd be disappointed with Cougar Town?
89,12,7,Netflix and neck?
78,15,2,Any chance you'll look for a job today?
71,4,1,Do you think we should invest in a curve screen? It all looks flat to me!
112,34,15,We're out of throat lozenges.
76,9,1,Place is great – TV is a little low though...
72,8,1,"I am having a hard time swallowing the Trump & Clinton ""truths""."
79,13,2,"How about a real safari for our next vacation, darling?"
98,25,10,Any idea how the remote control got on top of the trees?
100,28,10,"""Your mother specifically stated, 'No Necking'""."
75,10,0,"You know the drill - PBS, yes -- animal planet, no........"
78,9,2,Admit it... you won't be happy until we get a TV screen with higher resolution...
67,1,0,This is just what the manta rays are looking for. Wanna swap?
71,6,0,What do you mean you didn't reach your target?
76,9,2,The zoom feature is broken... I think you can adapt!
76,5,2,Binge watching the Bachelorette is not worth a sprained neck!
87,19,4,The way those wildlife shows portray us leaves me speechless.
96,21,9,"Darling, have you seen my green turtleneck?"
76,15,1,World's tallest mammals. Hah! Apparently we are smartest too.
113,41,15,Any woman who can break a ceiling like THAT has my vote.
73,7,2,"""Seriously, another Lifetime movie?'"
102,22,10,I told you we should have opted for the wall mount.
85,18,3,"What do you mean, you want more premium channels? Why, when I was your age, all I got to watch were the endless miles of the Serengeti!!"
110,31,14,"""Who needs a remote when you have a 12-foot neck!"
98,32,7,Darwin'so got to be rolling over in his grave.
90,20,5,They say it's her first glass ceiling.
112,42,13,The kids still at the zoo?
84,12,4,How many times have I told you not to put your hooves on the furniture.
81,12,3,Instead of watching 'Animal Planet' let's go out and be part of it!
90,10,9,How bout a longneck ?
90,14,7,Are we watching the Elephants or the Donkeys tonight ?
74,11,0,This place reminds me of our camping trailer.
77,4,4,"I'm sticking my neck out a little, but the screen in too low."
83,7,5,Actually I'm good with human-caused climate change.
80,16,2,How about something romantic and a whole lot of necking on the couch?
78,6,2,Should have gotten a bigger screen
89,17,5,I still think we should have wall-mounted it
77,9,2,Experiments on people have shown that looking down at a screen hurts your neck.
90,25,4,"At the risk of sticking my neck out, may I change the channel?"
101,36,10,The Human Channel is too violent for me
73,8,0,Still stressing yourself out with National Lion Convention coverage?
104,33,10,"I'd offer a neck rub, but it took three hours last time."
76,9,1,This sure beats Guantanamo!
92,6,8,"It's not neck to neck; trust me, she'll beat him."
95,24,7,"How many times hav I told you, take your feet off the couch!!"
83,14,3,"Ooh, is that a new Neil Giraffe Tyson series?"
99,30,7,"Really? 'Tiny Houses,' again?"
112,33,16,I'll grab us a couple of long necks.
81,13,3,Any room for me? Love to do some necking!
76,9,1,Turn that garbage off. Let's neck instead.
74,11,0,Don't you just love our vaulted ceilings?
76,7,2,Love to join you but I have the croup... hey... is that Marlin Perkins?
71,5,0,"I thought watching ""Swamp Wars"" was beneath you."
87,11,5,Satisfied? I told you that couch would be too small for necking.
98,34,7,Are you the same person who said she couldn't live on a preserve?
75,10,1,"Wild Kingdom comes on in ten minutes dear, how 'bout a nice big bowl of acacia chips and dip to go with it?"
91,21,4,As if captivity wasn't a reason enough not to reproduce ...
136,54,29,"Let's stay in today, Doris. It's a zoo out there."
74,18,1,"The donkeys are boring, and the elephants are dangerous. What's not to like about us? Gary Johnson, we're available."
82,17,1,I think the zebra costumes are a better fit.
92,25,5,Sorry I'm late but I was struck in a geraffic jam.
65,3,0,The Sept of Baylor explodes and everyone dies.
111,31,15,"It's nice, but personally I prefer tall-screen TVs."
83,8,4,So far so good. Now let's check the bathroom.
89,8,8,NatGeo again? Her neck probably isn't even real.
93,34,5,There was more to watch at the zoo!
99,24,10,How can elephants and donkeys even watch this stuff?
85,11,4,"We could have gone to Rio, dear. Giraffes don't get zika . . ."
107,45,10,"Last time you watched Predators of the Serengeti, you stayed in your room for two weeks."
74,8,1,Is Bernie Sanders on The Apprentice?
84,9,5,Don't worry Donald Trump Jr. only hunts Big Cats
76,8,1,"Lighten up. I said acacia, not euthanasia."
93,31,4,Time to upgrade to a tall screen.
81,14,3,"Hey, feel like necking tonight?"
65,1,0,I can't believe your dad is going to vote for him.
74,7,1,"If he wants my vote, he will have to change the party animal to something yuger."
82,11,3,"How many more times are you going to watch ""The Toys-R-Us story?"""
69,8,0,Are you watching those Animal Planet soap operas again?
81,16,4,Lets turn off the tv and get neck-ed!
65,3,0,Did you hear that Uber is launching a new animal service?
74,11,1,Your show is heads above the rest.
78,10,2,"No, you can't order it. We don't live in an area serviced by Amazon."
94,18,7,"Now that we finally got in, I never want to leave."
96,23,7,So you aren't even going to say anything about my new spot?
77,13,1,Stop watching that damn t.v. and lets neck!
76,9,1,Don't look down on their Soap operas.
68,10,0,"Blend in, huh?"
81,18,1,Have you tried the floor?
89,21,5,If you're so interested in elephants and donkeys we might as well go back to the zoo.
71,7,1,"I'm sorry but we've watched the program twice and they just didn't use the clip were you shouted out ""Baba-booey""."
79,6,4,"Yes, it's a shame. But ultimately even our necks show our age."
81,12,2,I suppose you also have the remote!
89,14,5,I can't believe you sat there and watched uncle Harry get eaten by a lion on the Animal Channel!
69,5,1,"To save this marriage, we must buy another TV for the den!"
76,7,2,I'm tired of necking. Let's get down to business.
81,10,4,Really? Zootopia??
81,10,3,"Soooo, you want to - uh, what' s the word: spoon? make out? Give me a sec, I'll think of it."
88,13,6,I'm just not in the mood to neck.
91,22,7,Come outside. I want to show you something on the roof.
79,9,2,Didn't I tell you that the HGTV Dream Home would be better than the zoo.
108,35,14,I told you this zoo was progressive.
79,10,3,"How bout we switch it to Lawrence Welk, and neck?"
80,13,2,I think Trump said we're going home!
68,3,0,"Sweetheart, I don't think this is what the therapist meant by ""quality time""."
95,21,7,"If it had been like this, I never would have left the ark."
107,27,12,"Honey, the leaves won't graze themselves."
120,45,19,"When Witness Protection said they'd give us a new location and a new identity, I didn't quite expect this."
81,9,3,"Let me know when they have the ""Housewives of Nairobi."""
79,11,2,Love these extra tall ceilings!
72,5,0,"Are you gonna scooch over, or is it a nudge yer after?"
114,35,15,"Our time will come, that donkey and elephant can't last much longer."
81,12,4,"No, I will not admit that the giraffe on that safari ad has longer legs than you"
91,22,5,Just donkeys and elephants? Sounds boring.
83,16,2,I really think that we need a wall mount!
104,28,12,How's that a Love Seat if there's no room to neck?!
111,36,13,I'm busting my tail at that toy store. You could at least strip a few leaves off the tree for dinner.
83,11,5,You're watching American Giraffiti!
98,17,13,"So I says to him, ""Look Lenny, I don't wanna go all PC on ya, but I really prefer to be called Girafferican-American."""
96,27,7,Do you suppose it was just chance that wide-screen TVs won out over tall-screen TVs?
75,8,1,I'm sorry but this is not like nuzzling in the Savannah.
78,9,2,They asked me to limbo at the office party. We need to start up Tall Lives Matter!
108,39,14,"I know she's the first woman, but we've always supported the elephants"
69,3,0,"I think it is in the spot, bur don't you think a higher?"
95,20,10,Who's up for a little necking?
75,8,1,Animal Planet has a show on tonight that has giraffe's in the wild.
81,13,3,Mother said no necking on the couch
79,11,2,"Watching 'Noah's Ark' yet again, dear?"
84,8,6,I think we need to rotate the screen vertically.
96,18,9,"Well, maybe just a little necking . . ."
103,15,11,I'm afraid 'Orange Is the New Black' wasn't what I expected.
73,10,1,You insisted we pay a ton extra for high ceilings. If you didn't intend to stand I don't understand the need.
89,23,3,"When the Zebras are here, just black and white."
69,4,0,Let's go dancing tonight.
66,4,0,Hey Jerry- either turn the mirror vertically or add two more...
78,12,2,We should really consider running as a third party option.
108,32,14,National Geographic promised they were gonna edit this part out.
97,12,10,I know a dung beetle that could write a better television show.
90,15,6,Toys R Us is closing.
76,4,4,They don't even make an adaptive remote.
79,11,3,"What do you mean, you're vegetating? There's no vegetation in here."
109,37,12,THIS is why we don't mate for life.
125,44,20,"There's not going to be a third party, and you're not going to be the mascot."
133,42,28,I can't believe you're going to vote for that baboon.
76,9,1,The Tree-Grazing Channel again?
72,4,2,It's always 'Shark Week' in Philadelphia.
82,9,3,Need the remote?
74,6,0,Did you really think elephants making a fool of themselves on TV was going to be funny?
91,14,8,"You just don't get aspect ratio, do you?"
104,23,14,That's my Spot. You're in my Spot.
68,3,0,"Guaranteed, knee replacements will be needed."
73,6,1,It's your week for the remote and mine for the couch.
93,27,5,But are we really happier?
88,16,4,You'll twist your neck sitting like that.
69,4,0,"Well, who made the magic go out of our marriage--you or TV?"
83,10,4,Who tipped the TV over?
90,28,5,"Honey, if one of the parties split, we could become mascots too."
82,11,3,"Whatching TV shows all day long, at least you need to stretch you neck or something."
79,6,3,How can we neck in that position?
100,26,9,"Yes, the HD is great but we could just go outside."
102,33,9,$100 a month and all you watch is Animal Planet.
78,10,3,Turning it horizontal doesn't help.
70,2,1,Tell me your not watching another silent film?
76,9,3,Don't watch those red neck programs. You've got too much to lose.
72,8,0,We either need a taller screen or neck reduction surgery!
201,83,78,"If he wins, we're moving to Kenya."
78,10,3,"I'll flip the screen vertically for you, honey, so you can see that video the way it was meant to be seen."
81,17,3,How about a little necking on the couch?
92,30,5,"I know it isn't hay, but the Knicks just offered me $15 million a year to play power forward."
76,9,1,All of this National Geographic is not helping your FOMO.
112,27,17,I ordered the pizza. Do you have any idea how we eat it?
68,6,0,I hate it when they order a half-carafe.
77,18,1,So glad we found this place with high ceilings.
93,9,9,I keep telling you there is no giraffe news.
88,14,6,We could sell this and get a tall screen.
84,19,3,I think that show's a bit of a stretch.
72,3,1,"I'm heading to Ikea, do you need anything?"
98,36,7,Sometimes you can be such a pain in the neck.
92,17,8,This convention's more depressing than LionWeek.
401,321,262,"Yes, it's hot. But a ceiling fan will only make things worse."
76,16,0,"Every day it gets more difficult"" to hold my head up."""
84,14,3,A little to the left...STOP...good. Now don't move till the show's over.
75,9,1,Madagascar again?
82,26,2,Do you think you can adjust the vertical ?
79,18,1,I've heard he wears stilts to appear taller.
71,6,1,"For a little attention, I'll buy you a wall mount."
92,21,7,"""I'll sit and watch the game with you, but no necking""."
83,21,2,"Just once, could we watch something besides ""Wild Kingdom?"""
90,18,5,"That does it. Next TV is portrait, not landscape."
114,30,15,What do you mean you didn't go to the interview? I stuck my neck out for you!
122,55,15,So when have you seen a giraffe in a leading role? Ever?!
80,11,2,"I said wall-mount, not Walmart."
106,25,12,We are not Party animals.
82,15,3,How about we hang it on the wall?
71,5,0,"You know just leaning in on the iPad has the same effect, right?"
80,20,1,It's a beautiful day out there. Why don't you and your brother go outside and play predator and prey?
80,7,5,"Bad news, dear. We've been classified as illegal immigrants. And we're being deported."
92,32,4,"I know they're cute, but this tiny house craze is not for us."
69,4,0,"Ella, when Uncle Noah said ""Ark"", he meant ""Mediterranean cruise""! Sookie-sookie now Mama!"
90,18,5,"Binge watching ""Wild Kingdom"" never gets old."
78,16,0,I have to chose between seeing the feet or seeing the head.
83,21,3,Not bad; just needs a tad more headroom.
79,7,2,Their running neck and neck. If Trump wins were gonna replace the elephant.
69,3,0,Really?
81,12,4,"Yes, I knew cable had a channel just for giraffes and - you know what? - it's still all crap!"
100,18,10,I tell you I tried. I can't get out the door.
112,38,12,At least we can look over his stupid wall.
79,10,3,Aren't you tired of watching your close escape from the Lion King?
90,18,6,"Don't watch too much TV, you'll strain your neck!"
93,18,7,... would it break your neck to have dinner ready?!?
80,11,2,"This time, I think the elephants will forget."
102,45,5,"Sure, wide screen's great but what about tall screen?"
82,12,4,You'll never see eye to eye with the donkeys or the elephants.
90,19,5,I think we should have mounted the TV.
86,14,5,I hate that the servicemen always install them so low.
180,106,55,"If he wins, we're moving back to Africa."
66,0,1,"I see urban leisure has turned our woodland cuisine of eating shoots and leaves to an imagined menu of stick 'em up, shoot, and run after."
67,2,0,When are you coming to bed?
80,11,3,It's a new reality show about giraffes in the suburbs.
71,4,1,Ok. I'm sorry. Now come to bed!
80,16,2,You're sitting on the remote again!
91,23,5,"Other than the low doorways, I could get used to this."
84,21,1,I agree. Giraffe Week would would enhance our brand.
75,8,3,You said you'd walk the dog!
170,96,47,Neckflix?

75,10,0,The Nature Channel is calling. They want to do a show on 'At Home With Giraffes.'
71,7,0,"Darling, am I a moderate or a progressive?"
103,44,8,What do you say we go scare some second story apartment dwellers?
83,13,4,The elephants and donkeys hired better PR firms.
96,29,6,"Well, they do say that television adds on ten inches!"
79,10,4,They asked me if we wanted to start a third party.
70,3,1,"You've got to stop watching reruns of ""Extreme Makeover"". Face it, in this political climate we're never going to be allowed to use the men's OR the women's bathrooms."

75,4,2,The politicians are acting like they've bumped their heads daily since birth.
120,41,19,Do you want acacia leaves just on your half?
74,8,2,"What's so fascinating about a Mr. Ed rerun?"""
92,15,10,Won't Goldilocks be surprised!

95,24,8,How's 'The View?'
94,22,8,"Do you never tire of ""Human Kingdom""?"
99,21,9,I prefer portrait over landscape layout.
77,6,3,In the meantime the tree leaves will be curling up.
125,54,20,You got a wide screen TV. I asked for a tall screen TV.
76,8,1,These conventions are such a zoo. Wonder why they didn't invite us?
125,58,21,I prefer Neckflix.

113,32,18,Soooo…Neckflix?
73,10,1,What is it about the Kardashians that fascinates you?
74,9,0,The Nature Channel should frighten you!
99,25,10,"Let's rotate the screen and watch Animal Planet, our people are on."

94,34,5,"Scooch over, it's time for Real Housewives of the Serengeti."

77,5,3,Speak up!
97,28,7,There's nothing good on TV--wanna' neck?
101,31,10,We should have gone for the tall screen instead...
103,32,8,"I said buy a high screen, not a wide screen!"
70,7,0,Why do you always have to take the giraffe's share?
80,10,4,"While you've been captivated by rhetoric and promises, I've been sticking my reticulated neck out all day long!"
97,27,9,I still say it's turned the wrong way.
82,9,4,The zoo we came from is looking better all the time.
122,39,21,Why don't you get giraffe off the couch and do some chores?
88,10,6,"Now that I think of it, your father had a long neck also."
75,13,1,"Do you think whoever started ""The Giraffe Channel"" is really sticking their neck out?"
98,28,6,"""If you had gotten the bigger screen, you wouldn't have to strain your neck""."
79,13,2,You're a real couch zucchini
76,15,0,Nothing new there. Just tall tales.
94,24,6,"No, dear, what we ordered was Netflix, not Neckfix."
77,13,1,Can we watch the Nature Channel?
71,4,1,"Yeah, but you rarely leave the apartment!"
144,74,30,There's no way her neck is real.
71,6,1,"I'm sorry Beth Anne, I still don't feel at home."
137,46,27,"Well, if they deport us at least we'll be able to see over the wall."

85,10,5,Tree foliage special on?
92,16,7,Slide over a bit and let's stay in - It's a jungle out there
82,13,4,Ew! Doesn't it hurt to watch TV siting like that?
82,16,2,With Trump you're sticking your neck out.

70,4,0,"What is more compatible with 'Game of Thrones' than a juicy, natural acacia branch?"
76,4,2,The Hyenas have asked us over. Are you in a mood for some disemboweling?
79,12,4,A little necking before we go into the other room?
90,27,4,I'm so glad we splurged on a place with high ceilings.
89,21,4,I still think we should have bought the tallscreen model instead.
100,34,8,I'm so glad we bought prewar. I love the high ceilings.
103,17,12,I'm going outside to clear my head.
73,6,1,Horror movies again? Why do you watch the shows about lions hunting?
81,15,2,You STILL can't see the lions sneaking up on Uncle Roy?
69,0,1,Let's watch the new season of WENTWORTH.
74,6,1,Are you watching 'Housewives of the Big Five' again?
90,17,6,"Want to watch ""Necked and afraid""?"
97,24,8,Next time can we house sit for taller people?
82,8,4,That show Giraffes Gone Wild is not what you'd think.
88,27,3,We should do something nice for the elephants next door.
70,1,0,"The Jerk Store called, they want you back."
107,28,12,"I'll join you on the couch, but no necking."
83,14,2,Will we ever agree on what is eye-level?
93,18,7,Even I'M finding cable news harder to swallow!
80,18,1,Mostly I'm just wondering how we fit through that door.
69,5,0,This first story is a tall one.
89,22,5,I can't believe I stuck my neck out for that lion at work.
106,30,13,I feel skittish. There's a lion sitting in a parked car across the street.
87,23,2,"So, acacia leaves for dinner again?"
80,20,1,The Tree Channel will get you in the mood.
95,21,8,Binging on Neckflix are we?!
75,10,2,and just where do you suggest I sit?
96,21,7,"Junior, I told you, Wild Kingdom is off limits."
72,7,0,"No, dear. A vertical kickstand won't solve the problem."
83,14,3,This binge watching is cutting into our necking time!
79,7,2,"2020, for sure, will be our third-party year! Yeah, Giraffes!!!"
80,9,5,You've got your head in the clouds if you think thy picked the right candidate.
72,8,0,They told me it had a long screen setting as well.
80,13,2,"I'm just saying, you can watch too many Attenburough documentaries..."
80,14,2,"HD cable, high ceilings and someone to neck with. Yep.....life's pretty sweet."
78,12,2,"Serengeti, Shmerengeti! What's on cable."
84,24,2,Why is it limited to donkeys and elephants?
75,9,1,...So you mean literally Netflix and chill.
77,10,3,"Sorry honey, I don't think they do tall screen TV."
106,22,12,I told you we should have mounted it on the wall!
75,9,1,"I tell you, that new zookeeper at work really gets on my nerves."
95,20,8,Try turning it the other way.
76,5,2,Ha ha. I am a giraffe and I am on a couch. That is silly.
88,16,6,I recall your last 3am infomercial got us these pajamas...
74,6,2,"""My love, sitting is the new smoking""."
80,14,2,"Looks like those ""elephants"" are bent on extinction."
86,17,4,You really think we need the remote?
103,35,11,Keep in mind that the camera automatically adds ten inches of neck.
73,8,0,You're such a couch coconut.
91,19,5,I can't understand your obsession with 'Tiny House Nation'
84,15,5,You up for some necking?
78,9,2,It's perfect if you want to fall asleep watching television!
82,13,2,Why can't we talk?
106,38,12,I guess four stars and 'pet friendly' doesn't mean we can get into the bathroom.
85,10,5,"Animal Planet's OK, but I've blocked Big Cat Diary."
101,29,10,You are right. Let's turn it the other way!
123,47,17,"Real Housewives of the Serengeti, AGAIN?"
73,12,1,"Not tonight honey, I'm watching a show about an endangered species of human."
78,16,1,Watching the Nature Channel sideways doesn't make the violence and sexual content appropriate.
70,4,1,"Tear yourself away, your dinner is getting tall."
82,15,2,"I don't think we should make-out tonight, I have a sore throat."
71,7,2,We'll just have to put up with the ceilings.
76,15,1,We could try rotating the screen 90 degrees.
77,9,3,This is the fifth time you've watched that Jurrasic Park movie.. I think you gotta thing for that Brontosaurus..!
80,15,1,Neither one has much of a neck.
129,63,21,Sit up straight. You weren't raised in a jungle.
87,18,4,"You are a lazy pain in the neck, Milton."
64,5,1,"""Animal Planet"" is such low hanging fruit!"
103,26,10,Try looking at it sideways.
89,22,4,They only did them in horizontal.
88,24,4,No remote needed
76,10,1,Time to change the light bulb?
82,13,4,"You know Ellie, this TV is becoming a real pain in the neck."
102,36,8,'Zoolander'? It's not what you think.
83,18,4,The zebras are getting more coverage this year.
85,19,7,Let's upgrade to tall screen.
118,53,15,Stay inside. It's a zoo out there.
107,43,11,"Honey, I can't find my good interview tie. I thought you laid it out on the bed, stairs, and kitchen table."
77,6,2,"It's ""Tall Story"" with Jane Fonda and Tony Perkins."
86,14,4,So where's the elephant in the room?
70,7,0,I always thought giraffes are better than donkeys and elephants.
86,14,1,"This election is a real zoo, isn't it, honey?"
83,26,1,I thought that 60” was the vertical measurement.
92,30,4,I like that Donald Trump. He hasn't insulted Giraffes yet.
77,6,3,In giraffe years you're a Millennial---so I'm kicking you out.
79,10,3,Have you seen 'To Catch A Predator'?
63,2,0,"Honey, do you feel like ordering some seaweed tonight?"
73,5,1,How low can you go wasting your time like those humans?
82,9,3,Hey Honey - Wanna' neck some tonight?
109,32,13,Remind me to do something about that door.
88,22,4,Neckflix and chill tonight?

142,60,31,"""Out of Africa?"" Again?"
111,45,10,It's a jungle out there.
68,5,0,Carol if you don't look at me I'm walking straight out that door
68,5,0,I feel uncomfortable - I don't think we can afford this.
75,10,1,I've blocked you from watching 'Zoo' for your own good1
82,20,2,I thought we decided that vertical worked better than wide screen.
75,11,2,Shall I go and get a longneck?
69,3,1,We need to talk.
104,27,11,You don't find the plot a little hard to swallow?
86,13,5,"""Airbnb needs to be more descriptive""."
70,4,1,You can watch 'Animal Planet.' I'm going to watch 'Zoo' on my computer.
105,19,13,I just don't see how Donald Trump could make tree leaves lower.
74,3,2,Politicians can't outrun lions on Realty TV
91,14,7,The curved screen is nice but I look forward to the tall one.
132,43,28,Get gir-affe off the couch.
157,87,33,"You could tell her a thing or two about glass ceilings, couldn't you, hon?"
80,12,6,I knew we should have gone with the 60-inch.
85,12,4,Turn off the TV and let's neck!
154,58,42,We have reservations on The Ark in case Trump wins.
81,14,2,"Good grief, it seems like everyone these days has an acacia leaf show."
95,24,8,What's this about an elephant in the room?
66,0,0,Binge-watching Season 2 of Game of Zoos?
74,9,2,"You've been stuck on that couch for, like, half a gestation period."
82,15,2,I told you they should have hung the TV higher
78,11,2,Nothing on TV tonight. Let's neck.
70,6,0,Why are you so interested in the Resolve ads?
84,14,4,Maybe the elephants will go home and we'll finally have our moment.
85,20,3,Up for some necking?
95,30,7,"Housewives of the Kalahari Desert, again"
108,21,14,I'm surprised Dracula movies don't scare you more.
98,23,8,"""Can I get you a highball""?"
81,13,3,"Steve, is it too much to ask..... maybe a night out every once in awhile?? Heather told me about this fabulous Acacia tree that she found near Fourth and Main."
89,12,7,"I know we're huge, but I am with Her."
97,22,7,We really need to get a wall mount.
77,20,6,You need to tear yourself away from the TV . . . your room looks like a zoo!
104,21,12,I can't get enough of these Toys R Us commercials.
82,17,3,Marlin Perkins reruns?
82,11,5,A little netflix and chill?
134,72,23,Big deal. I broke the glass ceiling years ago.
87,11,7,Don't ask me. I've never used the remote in my life.
77,15,0,These talking animal jokes never age.
83,8,4,I'm for going high.
73,11,1,"You can stay here, I'll take my chances outside."
93,14,8,"Well, if he starts in on giraffes, like every other minority, don't come running to me."
83,12,3,"Honestly, the lengths some of them will go to."
87,9,6,"If we mounted it on the wall, we wouldn't have to stare down at the screen."
86,16,5,I'm tired of just necking - Let's go to bed!
92,14,7,What we really need is a tall screen TV.
97,29,6,I'm tired of sticking my neck out for animal rights.
91,27,5,No wonder your neck hurts - the screen is supposed to be at eye level.
76,11,1,"If you want to neck, we have to get on the floor..."
97,32,6,"The Airbnb review was right, these ceilings are high."
76,14,0,Aren't you tired of seeing the same old faces on the Nature channel?
83,9,4,I see you're ready for some necking.
125,56,22,The Lyons invited us for dinner.
83,14,3,Why? Because you'll stunt your growth!!!
114,51,15,Grab your keys; there's a tree growing in Brooklyn.
70,4,1,Can you at least help me with the hors d'oeuvres?
133,62,26,You know the camera adds 10 inches.
90,22,5,"Hey, I've got some longnecks in the fridge, want one?"
150,77,34,"She broke the glass ceiling? So what, I did that last week."
93,18,8,Have you seen my neck pillow?
79,11,2,We can stay at the zoo when we compete in Rio.
80,13,2,Jeez. Don't you ever get tired of all these talking heads?
97,28,7,"When I was young, television sets were small and had fuzzy pictures but they did tastefully cut to the next scene as the lions made a kill."
113,34,13,Why do they keep making TV's sideways?
77,6,3,Is that really Bon Jovi?
82,15,2,Why weren't we chosen as political party mascots? Don't people realize tall is sexy?
92,26,5,Anything on GNN?
119,40,16,"Since the flood, you just sit there and watch the weather report."
103,23,13,This is ridiculous! Why can't we get a wall mount?
106,31,11,Feel like necking?
73,5,2,"Pixelated, schmixelated."
118,30,19,I've never been happier not to be an elephant or a donkey.
70,4,1,Did our leopard change his spots?
87,22,4,Well that's a stretch.
85,12,4,I know—how can we cut the cord now that they added The Giraffe Channel?
87,18,5,"I looked all over, dear. No one makes tall-screen TVs."
82,15,2,I'm always sticking my neck out while you relax
102,30,8,"So, did you get that pill down yet?"
94,12,10,When they go low we go high too!
106,44,11,"The kids used to look up to us, Fran."
101,23,9,We really should have rented that loft downtown instead.
92,27,6,Did you hear that? Trump is going to put us all in a Zoo!
87,11,6,"Can we please watch something other than ""Real Housewives of the Serenghetti""?"
78,9,2,You gotta keep your head up son.
77,9,2,Reality TV is fake. Let's go clean the garage.
207,146,80,Glad we got rid of the ceiling fan.
83,12,3,"For my birthday, I would love to have something very expensive: A wool turtle neck sweater..!"
78,6,3,You do realize that George Giraffe's neck is lengthened by CGI?
68,2,0,The Kardashians have really interfered with our necking time.
95,15,9,Are you serious? Did you just ask me what endangered meant?
72,8,0,"No, not your family, Mrs. Miller ... they're talking about beer bottles."
81,14,3,"Now, are you happy I got the package deal that included the Giraffe Channel."
104,30,10,Why do they keep making such a fuss about HER? You didn't have any trouble shattering the glass ceiling!
74,6,2,You're not fooling me sitting in front of the television. You can't use the remote control with your hooves any better than I can.
109,38,12,Give me a break!... like a herd of giraffes could really survive like that in the wilderness.
72,7,1,"If our neighbor calls me J. Ralph, one moe time, I may wring his neck!"
74,13,1,Little House on the Savannah will be on after a word for our sponsor.
98,31,9,"Before you buy a ceiling fan, measure the clearance."
88,23,3,"Sure, the big-screen t.v. in this sublet's good, but I REALLY like the high ceilings!"
107,35,12,Do you think sharks watch shows about us?
75,9,1,If you move over we could watch Safari Planet and do a little necking.
116,28,15,"I'm sure they mean elephant lives matter, AS WELL."
98,17,10,Noah can kiss my butt.
107,29,12,I'd rather be hunted by that Trump kid than have to hear him give a speech.
66,3,1,"Yeah, but you can still watch it with a little imagination. The 'snake screen' was cheaper than the 'giraffe screen'."
118,33,18,Nate Silver's saying it's neck and neck.
87,19,4,"Edna, I wish you would stop watching those stupid miracle spot removal infomercials. I've told you 1000 times, I love you just the way you are."
80,8,4,"Not Our Natural Habitat, But DAMN!"
170,121,43,The trees aren't going to trim themselves.
72,7,1,I got a crook in my neck yesterday from sitting that way and watching TV.
128,62,18,The Carnivores in Apartment 3 have invited us to dinner.
69,3,0,I'm not sure it's healthy you're still watching old reruns of Land of the Lost.
80,8,4,Elephants and donkeys! Elephants and donkeys! How discouraging!!
84,20,3,"l may be sticking my neck out, but I think you need to look for a job."
84,18,3,How did we ever survive without air conditioning and TV?
79,14,2,"If you like, I can hang the TV higher."
89,15,5,I told you too much screen time will ruin your posture.
99,32,9,We should have ordered the ceiling mount.
80,10,5,"The silent treatment, again?!"
76,9,1,We really need to install a taller door.
86,15,4,"Turn it off, dear. There's no way they can deport us all."
83,12,4,Why not raise the television?
69,12,1,It subtracts ten inches.
70,8,0,Don't stretch your neck watching that.
81,10,5,"If they repeatedly refuse to include us in their party platform, they ain't gonna get the giraffe vote."
72,7,1,"Sweetie, the wall will be too high for us to jump over."
84,20,2,I still prefer our life in the reserve.
78,14,1,"Argh, what did the elephants say now?"
77,7,3,Bad trip man
90,27,4,Sit up straight or you'll hurt your neck.
73,10,0,Get giraffe off my side.
102,27,9,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but now I actually feel bad for the elephants."
76,5,3,In addition to the flat screen television we are also featuring extra tall ceilings in this condo.
70,1,1,I'm ready for chill (italicized)
76,7,2,You never touch me anymore.
83,11,4,"Wanna neck, sexy?"
86,12,6,"Don't worry honey, we can mount it on the wall."
69,2,1,You said that you needed to get your head down for a while
92,28,4,"Watch all you want...there will never be a ""Giraffe Week""."
70,3,1,"""I'd really prefer that you say ""kiss""."
84,19,3,"""Real Housewives of the Savannah"" again?"
79,13,1,Our party needs a voice.
67,3,0,"Design On A Dime, again?"
99,22,11,"I don't care what we watch, as long as there are no elephants and donkeys."
74,12,2,"No, honey, I don't want to keep up with The Giraffians."
105,31,13,Your T V Dinner is on the roof.
119,45,17,"Am I wrong for wishing our new neighbors weren't, you know, lions?"
117,52,14,I strongly disagree with his position on migration.
96,32,14,"Even for me, that's a stretch."
87,17,4,Do you think we'll ever get a check from Animal Planet?
99,32,7,Noah's outside waiting in the Ark when you're ready.
98,21,9,Why is your TV sideways Jerome?
74,6,1,now no more neck strain from watching the old TV!

78,8,2,"Typical political bombast! No matter what they say, we have to keep our heads high."
95,28,8,What's on Neck Flicks?
81,8,4,I don’t care what it means. Don’t call your brother a camelopard.
67,2,0,"Are you watching ""The Real House Shrews"" again? The news is on."
103,27,10,Can we discuss the elephant in the room?
98,34,7,I've told you that I don't like watching these specials about lions before bedtime....
73,3,1,I told your teacher you were doing your homework.
90,20,5,I told you we should have bought the 170-inch screen.
90,19,5,These elections can be long drawn-out affairs and kind of hard to swallow.
88,22,3,Let's stick our necks out for Hillary.
86,8,6,I still thing it's silly for a hooved animal to own a remote control.
102,32,9,"What time is ""Giraffic Park"" on ?"
90,20,6,All I said was that she has good proportions.
104,39,13,Of course you're tall and thin enough to be America's Next Top Model.
82,20,2,Would changing the aspect ratio help - it'd be nice to see their heads.
96,24,8,"I know it's a stretch, but do you want to neck?"
65,8,0,Remember who you are. Think about it.
81,9,4,What are you watching? Say yes to the Turtle neck !
86,22,3,"Yes, maybe we should hang it higher on the wall."
77,11,1,Tsk. Horizontal format... so uncool.
76,16,0,"Don't you think we should invest in a vertical screen, so our heads don't get cut off?"
67,6,0,"There's really no point in opening the door for me, dear."
88,14,5,Wanna neck on the couch?
85,21,3,"...and then he had the nerve to say, ""TV is likely the cause of my neck problems."""
83,17,2,They totally don't get the ratio.
78,13,2,"Jack Hanna, again?"
80,11,3,Let me guess - Trump and Clinton are neck and neck in the polls!
75,8,2,"Hi sweetie, how about a bit of necking?"
85,14,5,"Yes dear, with that many martinis you might be seeing pink elephants..."
68,4,0,This reality politics is wilder than the wild.
80,17,1,Another infomercial on neck reduction surgery?
91,9,7,I'm worried how easily you're assimilating to our new country.
80,10,4,"First, it's $150,000 for a Harvard Law Degree, then $250,000 for a PhD in biophysics at Princeton. And, now, your goal in life is to be a minor league baseball team mascot???!!!"
100,24,10,I just can't watch the news any more. Its a jungle out there.
82,14,3,Binge watching Nature on PBS again?
96,28,6,Can I pour you a tall drink?
82,5,4,You left the door wide open and it's chilly in here. And now I'm feeling a giraffe . . . . . get it?
86,16,5,They Told Me That The Couch Seated Two
164,80,47,500 channels and all we watch is Animal Planet.
93,14,8,What happened to the wild life?
97,31,7,It's so annoying when they keep cutting off the heads of the main character.
96,13,9,I've had it up to eighteen-feet with your Nature channel bingeing.
96,28,7,"Toys R Us was a great gig, but it’s over. Time to move on."
79,10,3,Why else do you think we built this place with 22 foot ceilings?
114,53,13,Would you get off your lazy butt and eat the lawn?
72,10,0,You always liked balcony seats.
84,13,2,"If you were to get a job, young lady, a trip to the Serengeti could be yours in a year or two."
89,13,7,i was thinking sushi
69,3,0,"Usual day at the office, what's on?"
102,31,11,How are you liking your subscription to Neckflix?
100,22,11,Do you think we should have gotten the vertical screen?
72,10,1,It's got the neck room. Let's take it!
145,73,31,"You know the cheetah always wins, right?"
73,4,2,Can that monitor be re-oriented?
80,21,2,I told you we should have hung the TV over the fireplace
71,7,1,All that lowbrow trash is making you an animal.
74,3,3,It hurts my neck to look down that low.
65,2,0,How many times do I have to warn you about the breakneck speed of high-speed television!?!
71,11,0,We really need to get a higher-definition TV.
120,38,20,All the people trying to keep us out of captivity and here you are...
110,35,14,Don't you find it odd that all the movies on the ark are romances?
73,8,1,"Dearest, it's not only a jungle out there, it's a zoo, it's kill or be killed, it's survival of the fittest, it's like--hey, are you watching ""Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom"" again?"
76,6,2,Let's slip into something more comfortable.
75,4,2,Watching okapi bowling again?
85,17,4,"Ask the zoo for a raise, dear. We need a bigger couch."
106,29,12,25 million years of evolution down the drain.
94,25,10,We should've ordered Higher-def.
76,13,0,I get that you went on strike after Harambe's death but it's been two months. Get a job.
138,55,27,The top of the fridge is dusty.
90,30,3,I'll be impressed when it comes out in tall screen.
76,8,2,"I wish you could see far enough to recognize that Netflix is the new lion, and your lack of ambition is the new tearing my throat out."
85,17,3,"Oy, Real Giraffes from the Serengeti?"
87,16,5,"""Animal Planet"" and chill?"
102,22,13,Go tell those lions upstairs to turn down their music.
92,28,5,I prefer something more elevated.
70,5,0,Maybe next time you can just hoof the bill and have someone come wall mount the tv so we can actually see it.
121,49,17,You were more fun when we were in the zoo.
75,8,3,The candidates are neck and neck and still at each other's throats? It's a jungle out there...
84,10,5,"Before we got HBO, the couch was used for necking"
78,13,1,I suppose you'd like me to bring dinner down to you.
72,4,2,"It's the pre-season, Doug. You don't need to DVR it."
66,2,0,Huh. So 4K doesn’t mean screen size?
66,2,0,Do you got the remote?
72,6,1,Animal kingdom just doesn't seem to mean the same anymore !
101,29,8,I still miss Marlin Perkins.
79,10,3,I know its not healthy but tonight we get to look down at a retrospective on Kurt Vonnegut!
70,15,5,We are the silent majority.
97,26,8,I don't see a candidate that I would stick my neck out for!
81,20,2,"Unfortunately, Animal Planet is not part of our cable package."
69,5,0,This is what happens when we let the humans go outside to play Pokemon-Go.
87,22,4,"Don't be so glum, I'm sure the new zoo will still have HBO."
92,16,7,"Serengeti, Schmerengeti."
68,6,1,Get Giraffes of that sofa
86,17,5,"It's very nice, but you should have gone with a tall screen"
72,5,1,"Stop staring. It's a political convention, not a car crash."
102,23,11,I always found that show a pain in the neck.
85,14,4,Have you seen the remote?
69,3,1,"""You should have got one with a giraffic interface""."
94,15,9,How can you watch this lowbrow crap?
99,28,8,"You do understand that The Real Wives of the Serengti is scripted, right?"
78,6,3,Turn it off! Trebek's going into detail about okapi again.
85,16,4,Wild Kingdom is staged and rehearsed.
83,14,5,I don't care if you can clean your room without getting up from the couch. It's the principle of the thing.
84,22,4,Sorry I'm late. A bunch of rubberneckers caused a slow-down on the freeway.
85,17,2,Why don't we form a third party.
86,10,5,"Cheer up Gerald, at least we're not elephants."
78,17,2,"Damn politicians, they are all a bunch of carnivores."
92,17,7,"Stop sulking, Maude. I'm not looking down on you."
80,13,3,"""Let's get necked.'"
95,29,6,"You're really supposed to have that thing at eye level, you know."
80,14,3,We could teach them a thing or two about basketball...
71,2,1,Don't you miss Serengeti?
70,4,1,How about another Spotted Cow?
116,46,18,"You're right, this is a nicer zoo."
95,17,9,"Well, I think it should be on the wall, closer to the ceiling."
75,10,2,They reported you for overwatering our acacias.
78,10,2,GMA again? You said you would start that 'green' tree trimming service.
93,13,8,I hope he builds that wall.
99,40,8,"You know, if you watch TV all day your neck will stay that way."
197,126,71,Sorry I am late; I got stuck in the tunnel.
72,4,2,You want some popcorn?
104,28,7,Did you at least try to reach the higher leaves today?
88,12,8,Is my neck too long?
70,4,1,Like you'd ever make it on the Bachelor.
125,41,23,Your watching Deep Throat again?
127,63,22,Thank God for pre war ceilings
85,10,5,How come everyone looks so small?
99,25,9,It's the suburbs out there!
92,21,7,I'm glad you found some highbrow programming.
73,4,1,"Soooo Aerial, is that a family name or were you named after a type of fire truck?"
104,23,13,Even with our legendary peristalsis I'm having trouble trying to swallow either of these presidential candidates.
82,21,3,"I used to like the human nature programs, too. But that was before they started to show all those mating close-ups."
93,15,7,This sure beats the Zoo!
73,4,1,Watching Animal planet during the second day of our honeymoon! Are you homesick?
87,18,5,I asked again. They don't make them vertical.
130,54,24,We are out of grass.
92,28,5,Watching the Nature Channel is not helping your depression.
70,7,1,"You're not searching for ""Giraffe Week"" again, are you?"
89,11,7,Watching the nature channel all day is just going to make you more depressed.
98,28,7,"I told you to buy the ""tall-screen"" format!"
86,20,3,Move over and let's neck
76,4,2,"America's Next Top Model rejected you again, didn't they?"
81,20,2,"They're neck and neck? Yeah, right."
84,11,4,The store ran out of extra-tall wall mounts.
91,28,5,You'll pick up bad behaviors from watching the 'Human Channel'.
133,44,24,Who would have imagined fifty years ago that two lesbian giraffes could marry and live together openly?
71,1,2,"Let me finish this, Your Highness Damocles. It's hung there for ages. What's a minute more?"
77,6,2,You're addicted to Human Planet since Trump came along.
67,2,0,i checked with concierge...they don't have FOX news channel
80,9,3,Let's start a new political party!
67,4,0,Game of Thrones is a way better series than Veep. You can't even vote !!
79,6,3,"When I said we should return to the wild, I didn't mean re-watch all three seasons of Wild Kratts."
69,6,0,"Only just necking through the highlights tonight, dear."
69,5,0,"If they repeatedly refuse to include us in their party platform, they ain't gonna get giraffe vote."
89,21,4,I have no use for TV until a tallscreen format is available.
81,15,3,Can't we just neck tonight?
108,37,11,"It was only after I bought the thing that I realized that the ""high"" in HD had nothing to do with height."
72,7,0,Animal kingdom Again? I think your addicted to that program!
83,9,5,Let's stay home this year and visit our friends in Great Neck.
93,19,7,It's not exactly the aspect ratio we were looking for.
70,1,1,We should try and leave as soon as the convention is over.
143,41,34,I don't get it. Why did the Elephants nominate an orangutan?
132,51,24,What's on Neckflix tonight?
75,12,0,I'm going outside to stretch my neck before Wild Kingdom comes on.
101,22,10,Up for a little necking?
86,17,4,My folks won’t be home for an hour. Let’s neck.
78,6,4,"It's a mirror, but you have to get really low."
80,8,3,"""Is that cousin Gerry on TV with Jack Hanna?"
76,4,3,Enough convention watching. Let's get nekkid.
71,5,0,Do you know when the documentary about Marshall McLuhan comes on?
86,12,3,Animal Planet makes my spots feel bad ass.
96,29,6,I set the DVR to extended viewing.
89,19,4,Just as I thought! You’ve been sitting here watching football all weekend when you promised me you’d get to those leaves!
80,10,3,But you're the one who is better at changing diapers.
71,6,2,It's the latest thing; a wide screen TV.
78,9,3,"Don't be a pain in the neck, Stretch, move over!"
91,21,4,I'm going to stick my neck out and say that Donald Trump just embarrassed himself.
75,3,2,What did Bernie say?
134,41,25,I don't feel like either candidate really understands our situation.
72,5,0,"See, Trump’s wife is gorgeous, but her high heels are not high enough."
108,47,11,Your father and I think you should at least go for some low-hanging fruit.
93,32,5,"I told you ""high definition"" doesn't mean what you thought it did."
76,5,3,Because they wanted an elephant and a donkey.
78,4,3,Inappropriate ! Not enough nudity for your age.
73,9,1,This candidate simply can not reticulate his ideas.
86,16,4,Isn't there anything on besides National Geographic?
69,4,1,"Don't sit too close to the TV, you will hurt your eyes."
100,27,11,Wanna get high?
97,35,7,Brings the Serengeti right into the living room doesn't it?
108,23,14,"Lion porn, again?"
86,27,3,The hyena next door has his eye on you.
89,14,6,How about we watch a romantic movie and neck?
74,15,3,For heaven's sake don't stick your neck out for that candidate.
87,21,4,It's Animal Planet. They want to renegotiate your contract.
115,32,16,I'm thinking Leopard carpeting.
79,13,2,I will meet you in 10 minutes at the watering hole downstairs.
81,8,4,Does this reticulate make me look fat?
79,11,2,I told you to ask for a raise
84,14,4,Let's neck.
75,7,2,"You'll have to tip it horizontal to watch ""Giraffe Geopardy."""
68,3,0,Donkey and elephant were already taken.
71,4,1,"If our kind had vocal cords, I would tell you to vacate my favorite spot but since we don't, I will just motivate you to leave. Dinner's ready next doors."
88,15,8,Kardashians of the Serengeti again?
86,24,3,"You've got to get that TV mounted higher, honey--your chiropractor bills are adding up."
206,109,76,"The Viagra isn’t working, all I have is a stiff neck.”"
136,58,26,Maybe we should have gone with the wall mount.
71,6,1,A stiff neck ? I'll call the doctor again .
79,9,3,I heard the Washburns are going on another safari.
77,11,3,I always picture you reaching higher than this.
69,6,0,I'm going to the kitchen -- need anything to munch on?
68,2,0,You're actually becoming a couch potato!
111,23,14,"If we can't talk, how come we get captions."
76,8,2,"No, the shopping channel's fine. Just don't buy any more ladders."
87,24,2,"Well, it's official, the Livingstons have a sunroof on their new Range Rover."
88,15,6,I watch only high def.
62,20,2,"If they score, please…no more holes in the ceiling."
91,20,5,We either need shorter necks or a taller screen.
90,22,5,"If you keep sittting there, your neck will shrink."
131,53,22,"Honey, you broke through the glass ceiling long before Hillary."
105,24,14,"No worries, we'll be able to see over the wall."
81,14,3,"Next time we stage a takeover, let's find a species with more comfortable housing."
79,13,1,"So--- is watching ""Animal Kingdom"" reruns really worth giving up our Serengeti patch?"
89,14,5,"You've got to get a grip, Gladys... there's more to life than Animal Planet!"
107,22,15,Could we please watch something other than basketball?
85,11,5,Watching anything or just browsing?
76,17,0,Don’t you ever get sick of Human Planet?
96,24,8,A donkey or an elephant - hardly seems like much of a choice.
77,11,3,"You're addicted to those nature reality shows, aren't you?"
75,9,1,Cecil hasn't been showing up to work lately.
69,6,0,"Honey, you've gotta believe me - when I ordered it, I thought it the NECK-id Channel!"
111,41,12,This election makes me happy I live in Africa.
121,33,23,This is the Best. Zoo. Ever.
102,29,10,You always look down on whatever it is I want to watch. I've had it up to here.
89,18,5,The serengeti isn't going to be here forever.
77,8,3,"With these necks, can't you just watch the neighbor's television?"
69,4,1,Part of me wishes I couldn't stick my neck out for you.
107,35,9,"Face it Gladys, if you've seen one wildebeest migration you've seen them all."
100,31,8,Looks like the game is neck and neck.
72,4,2,I hope you appreciate that I stuck my neck out for the big screen!
92,30,4,Aren't you glad we're not the mascot for any of those bozos?
93,31,6,"As a female I of course relate to her, but I also identify with him for being orange."
78,6,3,I can see we have arrived in the middle class !
123,35,20,It's a zoo out there.
71,4,1,This television binging is unnatural.
78,6,3,"Let me guess,tonight we're having T V dinners for supper."
71,11,0,These city life documentaries in high definition are great.
78,14,2,"Animal Kingdom, really?"
88,28,3,Portrait or landscape?
96,26,5,"I've told you before, there's only one thing I hate as much as ceiling fans and that's small TV's."
77,13,1,Did you see the shower?
81,11,4,We should have got the one with the height adjustment
77,13,3,"But ""Real Housewives of Sub-Saharan Africa"" don't spend all day on the couch."
95,23,8,I'm taking it back -- even in widescreen mode we get cut off at the neck.
75,5,2,I was big catcalled on the way home.
74,10,1,"Move the TV closer, you're craning your neck."
85,8,6,I am sick of all the donkey and elephant shows
83,20,2,Really? 'Wild Kingdom' reruns again tonight?
75,9,1,"You've got to get out more. It's ""Shark Week"" anyhow."
78,7,2,Don't sit so close.
78,12,1,Maybe we should get out more.
71,6,1,I think the TV stand needs to be raised. I'm getting neck aches
100,30,8,"Scoot over, the pole vaulters are next."
70,6,0,"You've got some neck."""
80,19,2,Can't you wall mount the TV?
72,8,0,The Okapi cousins are here.
72,7,0,It's bestial how low the presidential debate can go.
68,2,0,It is time you served the dinner.
78,10,3,That'll rot your neck!
95,30,8,You've watched this a dozen times. The lion always catches the giraffe!
134,49,27,"If you buy one more neck pillow from QVC, I'm canceling the credit card."
78,14,1,And he doesn't shed?
67,0,0,Let's start a movement.

77,7,2,What remote?
86,14,5,"Slide over, two glasses of wine, some cuddling, and lots of necking?"
75,10,1,Look at those the silly elephants and donkeys.
79,7,3,"Jeffrey, you have all those nice toys. Why are you always watching TV?"
84,16,3,It looks like the candidates are running neck and neck.
79,12,2,At least 'The Real Housegiraffes of New York' are getting some dinner!
68,3,1,"There is nothing topical about giraffes, Brenda."
77,9,3,You do know that wrestling is fake right?
74,3,1,"You know, when I was your age, we were never allowed any low-hanging fruit like the kind of bathroom humor you're watching."
95,29,7,"Next time we migrate, can we not use Airbnb?"
71,6,1,"Can you call me when ""Botched"" comes on?"
65,0,0,"Hey, I just coop master's corpse up in the garage. So, what should we do next? It's matter of time before cops realize."
83,12,4,I wish the ceilings weren't so low.
88,17,4,'He's no Elephant'.
80,6,4,Not another Randy Newman special?
95,36,6,"You know, it’s not the Serengeti, but it’s not bad."
85,15,3,"I get home from a hot grueling day at work on the Serengeti, my supper's not ready, and I find you binge watching 'Animal Planet'."
72,1,2,The voting for Hillary thing I can see; the holding your nose thing? Not so much.
75,9,3,"I telling you, Henry, if you don't start getting some regular exercise, your going to turn into a couch acacia."
81,9,5,You never want to graze the bush anymore.
65,4,0,"Did the realtor say co-op, or coop?"
95,21,8,What good are 189 stations and a remote without opposable thumbs?
94,24,6,I don't understand your fascination with donkeys and elephants lately
72,7,1,Sophie's Choice isn't the French children's film you were expecting?
93,19,9,"Isn't this the episode of ""When animals attack"" where your cousin yells at that waiter?"
74,9,1,You got to stop watching Keeping up with the Kardashians on Human Planet.
103,39,9,You know watching Wild Kingdom before bed gives you bad dreams.
82,14,3,Do you want grass or leaves for dinner?
74,9,2,Do you really think the donkey and the elephant have it so good?
76,12,0,"Junior, that posture may strain your levator scapulae, please do a few minutes of downward dog on the next commercial."
110,38,12,Do I look like a Leopard in this?
74,6,1,"Yeah, it's disappointing. The conventions are over and they still have those old mascots. Maybe next round we'll find our voice."
78,15,4,You said you wouldn't watch Planet Earth without me.
84,17,3,Maybe we should have sprung for the house with 60 foot ceilings.
75,9,1,Do you want to watch Wild Kingdom?
79,11,2,"Necking on the couch, again?"
82,8,4,"Even if I could reach the remote you dropped under the sofa, how could I change from the Weather Channel?"
71,7,0,"Honey, let's go outside and dance with the stars."
101,25,9,"I said high screen,not wide screen."
83,17,2,"Honey, my first day of work was a pain in the neck"

111,43,11,Even if he does build a wall we will be fine.
115,29,16,"For optimum viewing place base of television 32"" above the floor... I'd like to speak with the no-neck Gazelle that wrote these specs!"
89,7,7,"If it's any consolation, I feel bad about my neck too."
69,5,0,Tough day at the office. My boss told me to stop 'Giraffing.'
73,4,1,How the neck are you?
93,12,9,"""Orange is the New Black"" is not about giraffe spots, honey."
108,15,16,Get giraffe off the sofa!
91,27,6,I'm not sticking my neck out for you again.
85,19,3,Is this the one where they meet and run off into the Serengeti and live happily ever after?
125,59,20,"It's true, the camera adds three feet."
109,27,14,"Call me old-fashioned, but I say we just stay home and neck."
85,19,4,Stop fooling around—put the TV back on its side.
128,51,22,I feel like Hillary really 'gets' our ceiling issue.
124,47,21,Need anything from the tree?
81,10,3,Congratulations. You are the first couch potato giraffe
68,5,0,What am I now? A man stretching his legs on a plane!
70,8,0,"Sorry, it's not like a printer, everything's 'landscape' setting."
76,8,1,So glad we finally got a high definition TV!
82,12,4,"""Shortest Loser"" on yet?"
86,10,6,All I could find was horizontal format. There's no sensitivity to diversity in the population.
77,16,1,Salad? Again?
74,13,6,Why are there no TALL screens?
75,8,2,Want to Netflix and chill with some Planet Earth?
80,13,2,I thought these vampire shows were giving you nightmares?
104,21,12,Walking Tall ?
74,8,1,It looks more fun than necking!
114,31,17,I wish they would bring back Marlin Perkins.
71,8,1,"""Watching real housewives of the savannas again?"" They have such wild life styles""...."
90,15,8,Does it really matter where the remote control is?
67,3,0,"I love that you phoned me when your television died. You are not going to miss even a minute of 'The Love Zoo.' In the meantime, may I interest you in a tall drink? And maybe one of my famous neck rubs?"
79,10,3,Sucks to be an elephant.
94,26,6,"There go the elephants, making asses of themselves again."
81,17,3,Just lie on your side and quit complaining!
91,22,5,"I'm just saying that if we wall mount the thing, your neck will straighten back out."
99,27,9,"Move over, I wanna neck."
99,22,11,You installed the screen on its side.
86,15,5,"Sit and chill, I'll be outside eating a tree."
89,28,3,"I know you miss the Serengeti dear, but at least we found a place with high ceilings."
77,5,3,"Kung Fu Panda, Gorillas in the Mist, Angry Birds, or Finding Trump?"
94,21,8,Makes you glad you're not an elephant.
82,11,5,"Americans want truth in politics? That's a tall tale or tall order. Either way, it's a stretch."
74,8,1,Do you want to talk about the awkward Elephant party nominee in the room?
104,25,11,Why did you turn it sideways?
71,6,0,Don't you ever get tired of watching funny giraffe videos?
94,16,8,"I KNOW I AM STICKING MY NECK OUT, BUT COULD WE WATCH SOMETHING OTHER THAN ANIMAL PLANET TONIGHT?"
99,35,6,Accept it. We're living in a vertically challenged culture.
86,16,3,"""Attack of the Lions"" again! Can we watch another horror movie?"
70,4,0,Too much necking at Fox News.
72,5,1,"Are you still binge watching ""Keeping up with the Krustaceans?!"
66,4,0,"Watching the Olympics, who do you think will win the high hurdles?"
73,10,1,I know a zoo when I see one.
86,16,7,These jungle soaps would be more exciting if they added some necking.
100,29,11,Go outside and roam.
85,22,2,But nothing in her platform speaks to even-toed hoofed mammals.
80,12,1,"Of course ""Sharknado"" is not real. There is no watering hole in the world that big."
96,16,9,"Hillary's no Dalí, but she paints a better picture than that orangutan."
79,7,4,Don't you get tired of watching animal shows?
68,3,1,"Check it out, totally retro...the Cat's name is Marlin Perkins."
78,12,1,Is this the nature channel or the food channel?
111,29,13,Widescreen doesn't do a thing for me.
88,16,5,"You're right, we can't fit through the door to leave, but that raises the question of how we got in here in the first place."
89,15,6,I won the new TV in a giraffel.
76,13,1,I'm sick of you looking down on me...
77,15,1,Is this Giraffic Park 2 or 3?
87,16,5,Did you buy an adjustable stand?
85,16,3,"But giraffes are High Definition, by definition!"
102,25,9,Tarzan again?
74,14,0,"""I warned you it would make your neck look huge""."
93,30,4,"Honey, I'm thinking of having a neck reduction."
83,9,5,It’s giraffe porn. 47 necking positions.
80,9,4,Mmm!! my favorite negligee! The kids must be at your mom's!
77,12,1,Please not another documentary.
95,29,6,Now you can see why human beings became extinct
67,1,0,Do you love me more because I've always been for women for all positions except for you?
73,8,1,"At least the elephant won't be able to tell the ""sticking your neck out too far"" joke ever again."
65,1,0,"TV rack anyone? Remember, the 90s are back!!!"
92,33,3,Can YOU please go talk to the kids? They're behaving like wild animals again.
77,6,3,"It's not even plugged in, so what are you staring at!?"
69,5,0,You're an insult to all self respecting couch potatoes you can't even lay flat!
76,14,0,"Animal Planet, just another version of scripted reality"
77,13,1,"Yes dear, I'm certain you'd win if there was an olympic competition for 'Treetop Chomping'."
81,10,4,Is the race still neck and neck?
83,9,4,"Ha know, Geoffrey, it might be time your stop acting like such a Toys 'R' Us kid and you got out and get a job!"
104,27,10,Did she eat the final rose?
75,10,1,I told you we wouldn't be able to spoon on a loveseat.
91,18,6,American politics. It's just a bunch of donkeys and elephants.
75,4,3,Let’s watch the Discovery channel show about the vanishing tribes of Africa. I heard is both fascinating and tragic.
82,8,5,"Look, Dana, I know you're having trouble with the move, but for the last time, there is no elephant in the room to talk about."
85,17,3,Who had the bright idea to have TVs horizontal?
72,5,1,"I know it's a lot smaller than our old place, but dammit -- we've got hi-def!"
68,5,0,It's not us. Cable is out in the whole neighborhood.
66,5,0,"As much as I love the extra high cube walls the gang chipped in for down at the office, I feel like I hardly know what's going on in anyone's personal life anymore."
77,11,2,It's hard to look up to you when you're watching TV.
97,22,8,Enough of the convention. Let's watch Animal Planet.
80,16,3,They don't make tall screens.
88,18,6,"Okay, okay. I'll bring you some popcorn. But just know that if you get it stuck in your throat again, you're gonna miss the whole movie."
103,33,10,"Something's wrong with the color. Humans don't come in orange, do they?"
70,1,1,I'm Nuts Over TV !
79,8,4,Nova's 'Nature vs Nurture' again?
82,10,4,"Go figure, a donkey instead of us."
74,11,1,Makes me thankful I was born a giraffe.
67,1,0,You won't reach your natural potential by lolling about like that.
108,32,11,"Oh, c'mon, Veronica. It's only a sore throat."
81,20,1,Watching Wild Kingdom again Ethel? Aren't you tired of seeing Trump?
86,19,3,You never take the long view.
93,24,7,What's the point? You can never get anything in your size.
94,14,7,"Billy's teacher called, Billy was caught necking during recess."
85,22,3,"Long day, honey?"
74,9,0,"No, I don’t think poachers are just misunderstood bad boys."
74,10,1,"No, the figures on the screen don't get taller if you turn the TV to vertical."
91,28,6,"Crick in the neck, sounds serious, how long will you be off your feet?"
70,5,0,"Well, I don't want to watch it if you've already seen it."
80,14,2,The Chew?
84,13,4,May I sit neck to you?
92,13,8,"Really Mabel, the guy from Wild Kingdom.."
83,16,2,"I'm thinking a Long Island Iced Tea, how about you?"
68,4,0,"Hey, you wannna have a neck fight?"
92,14,8,Stop watching Animal Planet and go outside.
115,43,14,Did we ever receive residuals from this National Geographic program?
73,7,0,The least you could do is sit so I could enjoy your lovely legs.
77,8,2,Wanna check out the red room? We could do a little necking.
89,23,6,"Forget watching the conventions dear, those damn elephants and donkeys do not represent us!"
99,37,8,What is this obsession with basketball?
80,11,4,It no longer seems like a zoo in here now that the elephant has left.
93,18,7,They say they're tired of being called jackasses. They're looking for a new symbol.
89,11,6,"You've become a disappointment to both the kids and your mother , Geoffrey ."
81,16,3,Really..I can't believe you're still watching the real house giraffes of the Serengeti?!
80,8,4,"No, no, this is all wrong, I ordered a 'Chaise Extra-Longue' and a 'Tall Screen' TV!"
101,24,10,No. There's no such thing as a tall-screen TV.
120,33,19,I told you to buy a wall mount!
87,27,2,I think it's time to upgrade to the tall screen television.
74,6,2,"Well, did Netflix also happen to mention that sitting is the new poaching?"
95,24,6,Are you sitting on it?
123,35,19,"Yes, I've seen your Toys R Us commercial a million times already."
114,38,15,Why is the screen sideways?
76,7,2,Animal planet is on ch.43
72,3,1,I told you we couldn't fit through the door.
67,3,0,You heard what the president said.... Democracy isn't a spectator sport! It's time to get out of the house and do some door-to-door campaigning.
79,10,3,How about a little necking?
79,15,1,I'm so much happier with this new upholstry; animal print is just so distasteful.
85,11,5,I’d like to see her try to break through a pre-war plaster ceiling.
106,43,12,So good to be home. It's a real jungle out there.
80,11,2,"If we're going to neck, you'll have to move over a bit."
80,17,1,There's just so little for giraffes anymore.
86,23,2,"Since you retired, Animal Planet just hasn't been the same."
87,14,5,Bob is at the door again. This time he wants us to PAY for the damage to the trees.
95,23,6,We've been in all day. Let's go outside and stretch our legs.
78,6,4,So how's the Sex Life of Giraffes Mararathon on Animal Planet coming along?
99,33,7,"To celebrate our new home, whaddya say we raise the roof?"
67,2,1,"Relax, they said they would leave if he won."
84,8,4,What elephant?
80,15,2,Noah thinks we're addicted to Neckflix. Are we?
114,41,15,I'm gonna grab a long neck. You want one?
92,17,7,Watching Human Planet again?
91,21,6,The 10 foot ceilings really make this place........
105,20,13,"""This convention coverage is tough to swallow""."
76,8,2,I sill can't believe you watch Life is Short
69,5,0,Penguin? Might as well vote elephant.
80,17,1,I’ve requested an ergonomic review.
74,4,2,"I wanted something with depth, but I all I see are overviews."
76,10,1,I love Safari!
98,18,9,It's the RNC coming live from the Cleveland Zoo.
97,25,6,Animal Kingdom is not a reality show!
95,27,8,Animal Planet? Dear Lord. This is supposed to be a vacation!
67,2,0,"Honey, let's turn off the TV and just snuggle on the couch tonight."
100,32,8,"These new, humane zoos are great, but I wish there were more cable options."
75,8,1,No big deal. You've been breaking through drywall and plaster for decades.
90,17,3,Don't you wish they made tall screen TVs ?
79,9,2,I bet most people don't realize our 'spots' are really necking hickeys.
89,11,7,Do you think Mrs Goldman might tire of browsing acacia leaves in the punishing heat and want to swap back?
108,35,13,We left the Serengeti for this?
80,11,2,Which is it...The Real Housewives of Kenya or Zimbabwe?
73,4,1,"Move over, there's no room for me."
78,7,3,"In spite of the Witness Protection Program, I think Moses has caught up with us."
77,16,2,"Err...Miss Jones, I'm about to stick my neck out."
89,15,6,"""I thought we were going to get it Portrait mode""."
81,20,1,He's too short for you
76,5,3,Aren't you sick of ruminating?
83,8,5,I told you not to skimp on the mount.
91,18,6,Noah assured me the lions are in a separate annex.
116,28,17,"I love you, I love the show, but a ""tiny house"" just is not for us."
102,24,11,I don't feel like either campaign has reached out for the giraffe vote.
122,32,22,"With all this diversity on TV now, I think we can stop pretending we're sisters."
70,6,1,He sure made us great again
88,23,5,Election coverage? We put the circus behind us.
90,27,4,"Not ""Wild Kingdom,"" again!"
119,41,17,I told you we should have gotten the wall mount.
85,21,3,Hee hee! When they come back they’ll blame the hairs on the couch on the dog!
90,17,6,"Dear, let's put on a romantic movie and neck.."
77,13,1,I think we need a wall model.
104,28,10,Can I get you fifteen pillows?
87,15,3,"Just because Toys R Us is closed, doesn't mean you give up Geoffrey."
102,28,10,If you turn it on it's side the kids heads don't get cut off.
99,29,8,Why do you have the TV on its side?
94,22,7,"Why is the elephant wearing an ""I LOVE PUTIN"" T-shirt?"
74,7,1,You do realize our cache if this wall gets built.
82,12,3,"Honey did you know that Hillary has been sending private emails to the Bronx Zoo?"""
164,78,44,"Sure, roaming the plains of Africa sounds amazing, but you're not seriously thinking about giving up a rent controlled apartment in Manhattan, are you?"
77,11,1,"Well, well, well! Aren't you the couch potato!"
77,11,1,Are you still binge-watching Animal Print Is the New Black?
104,40,9,Let me guess! You have another sore throat!
69,7,0,"Alright, Linda. You win. This isn't funny anymore. Can we go home now?"
67,4,0,Did I just see Zebra climbing out the back window?
82,24,1,I told you we should have bought the L-Shaped couch.
86,14,6,"Turn off the TV, sweetie, and let's neck!"
68,5,0,Comfortable silence it is!
89,18,6,Tell me again how the race is 'Neck and Neck'.
69,5,0,"You can't spend all day watching ""Little Necks"" epidsodes."
77,8,2,"You gotta agree, this ark's posh accommodations are nothing compared to this Trump suite."
71,7,0,You're always hogging the couch!
89,14,6,We didn't get out of the zoo just so you could watch Jerry Springer all day.
74,10,2,"Watching ""Cutthroat Kitchen"" again?"
97,20,8,I just discovered these horns are for wifi
92,25,5,I will never understand why coffee gets cold once it reaches my stomach!
74,16,1,Binge watching the Animal Planet?
79,13,1,I am fantasizing about becoming a ROCKETTE
88,25,3,I still can't believe they went with the donkey
66,0,0,telephone for you!
78,13,1,Lean closer if you can't see it.
82,14,5,Let's put on a rom-com and neck.
72,9,0,You are only allowed to watch Movies rated G (for Giraffe)
109,37,13,"She broke the glass ceiling, not us."
85,11,3,"David Attenborough, AGAIN ?!?"
80,17,1,When you suggested we live with your parents you did NOT mention that they weren't giraffes.
94,24,6,The race is still neck and neck.
93,26,4,Why do you watch those wildlife shows when you have the real thing right here?
79,8,3,"Stop watching TV, get off your ass, and get down to the watering hole where you belong."
89,10,6,"Derrick Rose has a bum knee, too, but you don't see him moping around watching Dancing With The Stars."
102,24,11,"It's our epoch sequel, 'Giraffic Park'."
74,12,1,Why do we have to use the back door? Why can't we go through the front lobby like everybody else?
102,26,7,You'd think the 'top-rated zoo in America' would feature cathedral ceilings.
89,14,5,We ordered a portrait TV and they sent us landscape!
79,12,4,"Watch the convention if you'd like, but they won't really change their stripes."
102,19,11,So glad I'm not an elephant or a donkey.
92,17,7,"You were right, Fred, Instead of the flat screen we should have gotten a tall screen"
90,26,5,"long day, ya know... it's a jungle out there!"
70,4,1,Your mother in law is giraffing me crazy
70,9,2,"Really, Bernice, you look sexy in pixels."
87,18,4,Did you know humans have the same number of neck vertebrae that we do?
100,23,11,I wonder how our housing exchange partners are doing in the Savannahs.
114,44,14,Nothing's on TV. Wanna neck?
79,18,1,"You know, if you just mount it on the wall it will reduce your neck-strain."
155,74,35,The Lyons invited us over for dinner tomorrow night.
72,12,0,The high resolution feature is what sold it for me.
96,30,7,"You know that couch isn't good for your neck, right?"
86,19,5,Orange is the New Black isn't about giraffes at all.
72,7,1,Would it kill you to put that thing on a wall mount?! Our necks won't be young and supple forever you know.
69,8,0,The former tenants were pymy hippos.
86,13,5,What a relief not to be elephants or donkeys!
83,25,1,I don't need wide screen; I need tall screen.
101,27,9,"I'm addicted to Judge Judy, even though I know a kangaroo court when I see one."
132,56,22,The neighbors want their gutters cleaned.
75,9,3,"Has the ""Slam Dunk Contest"" started yet?"
71,6,1,"Noah’s Cruise Liner is awesome, but the midnight buffet is definitely not for vegetarians."
78,10,2,"They like their models tall, but with animals, they go for shorties."
80,11,2,Don't waste your time. The signal is spotty.
156,74,39,"So, Trump says he wants to send us all back to Africa... but I was born at the Bronx Zoo!"
97,19,9,These cartoons are so unrealistic.
97,25,8,"I hear that the GOP elephant is retiring, but I wouldn't want that job."
104,37,10,"Quick! Put on the game, I hear it's neck and neck."
86,10,6,In this case the elephants are bringing extinction upon themselves
80,11,1,"But he said zebras and wildebeests were the greatest, too."
70,3,1,At least the consolation prizes will provide us with a comfortable captivity. I'll always regret not picking the right door!
77,7,2,"Sarah, it is pronounced ""Netflix and Chill"" not ""Neck-flix and Chill""."
89,13,8,I'm still looking for a vertical screen TV.
86,19,5,"You lazy ungulate, get those filthy hooves off the sofa."
76,7,2,It's presented in 87:9
86,22,2,I see you've been binge watching Neckflix again.
86,16,4,"I tried Animal Planet, National Geographic. No real giraffe news."
69,3,1,"Want to watch the antelopes rut on Animal Planet, or should we just go neck?"
74,8,1,I always told you that we could rightfully look down on those elephants and donkeys.
97,22,10,Looks like it's neck and neck.
78,13,3,You are so giraffeing lazy.
95,22,7,I need you to mow the savanna today.
87,19,4,"It was a good speech, but she didn't say anything about giraffes."
70,5,0,Democracy doesn't exist.
74,4,2,Getting that thing through the door was such a hassle.
79,4,4,"I'm sorry, ok. Will you please come back to bed, now?"
118,45,15,Anything high-brow on?
79,7,1,"Dear, Bror cheats on Karen who falls in love with Denys. It's just another predictable Streep film!"
69,8,0,"I spotted a humanamuh today, but then there were so many I stopped counting."
68,2,0,The ceiling's too low
92,28,5,"Ya wanna know how hectic work was today? I tell you, it was a zoo!"
84,13,2,Have you even munched today?
83,15,3,At least Trump is willing to stick his neck out.
77,11,1,"Have you seen my coupons for a free neck rub, dear?"
97,22,10,"I want a soda, but that lion is still hiding behind the fridge."
94,23,8,I prefer the Elephant party but their guy reminds me of a Donkey.
80,11,3,"I've got the next five hours free. Do you want that neck massage, now?"
97,14,11,You've become the elephant in the room.
78,9,2,I agree. Necking on the loveseat sure beats getting stuck in the trees along Lover's Lane.
78,4,3,"Honey, I really have a huge problem with your decision to vote for Donald J. Lion."
102,27,11,Not tonight? Is it that sore throat again?
79,8,3,"I'll stick out my neck and say, no I don't like soaps."
93,23,6,It's funny. These political pundits think they are sticking their necks out.
72,9,0,Need ceiling mounted once again I prove correct.
75,11,2,They should of picked us over the elephant: we also stick our neck out!
76,10,1,Get off the couch with your shoes on!
79,9,4,I can't find the remote.
80,17,2,"I can't stand watching the news anymore, it's a jungle out there."
77,3,3,Hey. We are giraffes in a house.
96,18,9,"Please tell me you didn't order another multi-purpose, 14-foot ladder."
73,5,1,I keep forgetting that these screens are measured diagonally.
87,20,5,I hope you're not watching The Lion King again!
107,36,12,Two million years of evolution so that you can change the station with your nose instead of using the remote?
69,8,0,How long have I been saying that this television is just not at the right height?
104,31,10,Break time is over. Back to entertain the zoo visitors.
80,11,3,"Oh, I've got this! What is ""Born Free?"""
83,5,5,You give really good neck.
83,15,3,I'm so glad they chose donkeys and elephants.
74,9,1,Wide screen schmide screen how about tall for a change!
87,14,5,"No, I never met Tarzan, and neither did anyone else."
103,33,12,It's tough being tall in a wide-screen world.
95,27,6,Move over sweet thing and let's neck.
82,19,8,"What's the big deal with breaking ceilings, glass or otherwise?"
92,19,6,"Sure, the picure's great, but when are they going to come out with a 'tall screen' television."
96,16,9,Just stop watching. It's beneath you.
85,11,5,"Obviously we'll start with some necking, but where is 2nd base?"
124,50,20,It's beneath us.
80,11,2,"""Let's go down to the watering hole and grab a couple of 'longnecks'."
69,5,0,DID I EVER TELL YOU WHAT BIG EYES YOU HAVE.
73,3,3,I'm just so tired of the silence.
109,35,12,"With a little effort, you wouldn't need the remote"
99,29,9,I told the zookeeper he gets his house back when we get more acacia leaves.
80,16,1,"If you don't move over, off goes Animal Planet!"
97,21,7,"STOP DREAMING, THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO DO A SHOW ABOUT THE HOUSEWIVES OF THE SERENGETI."
76,12,0,You're binge watching Downton Abbey again?
71,3,0,We need our neck pillows to get through another convention.
76,9,1,You can't look away? Then just stand up and be above it all!
72,7,2,"They’re bringing back The Wire, and it’s set in the Serengeti!"
101,43,6,"What is it about ""Place monitor at eye level"" that you don't get?"
85,6,5,I know you think I'm sticking my neck out......
82,19,2,Is that my orange-spotted turtle-neck sweater you're wearing?
83,17,2,Are you watching Human Planet again?

82,12,4,My neck is killing me
86,22,4,It's a savanna out there.
78,11,1,Fine. One more and then it's off to the savannah.
84,12,6,This new wide angle TV does nothing for me.
71,6,1,You should read more books.
89,17,8,"Humph, certainly not for me - living off-the-grid in some sweltering savanna."
81,10,5,"Is that the original Walking Tall, or the sequel?"

107,36,12,"Don't worry. I just scored passes for us on the Ark, if Trump wins."

98,25,8,"We need a tall screen, not a wide screen."
77,8,2,"I keep on telling you,  is no such a thing as a giraffe channel!"
86,13,7,I bought that love seat for a reason.

94,27,5,That's enough tv young man... go out and stretch your legs.
107,28,13,We never neck anymore.
98,27,9,"To be honest, I prefer the old zoo"
75,5,2,I would caution you not to put too much faith in those tall tales that Mr. Trump is espousing.
62,1,2,"""You know, Dear, I liked Bill Clinton's positive, upbeat speech of Hillary, but after the G.O.P. ""dumped on Hillary"" so bad, I think Bill should have ""stuck his neck out"" a bit and 'dumped the Trump"" back."
74,7,1,"""We could use a larger TV""."
79,12,1,Instead of necking all you want to do is watch TV.
69,1,1,"I hate sitting on the blue sofa! I had such a crick after that double episode of ""Serengeti Betty"" last week."
85,15,4,Don't blame me when all the good leaves are gone...
105,34,11,I sprung for the premier ark stateroom.

68,1,1,It's high time we switch to Animal Planet.
77,11,2,Animal Planet again?
84,20,3,"Mounting the TV on the wall would have been better, no?"
86,10,5,These modern zoos ROCK.

90,18,3,I love PBS programming. It's so... Highbrow.
94,14,9,Noah's Ark is so comfortable darling .I am so glad we decided to board!!!
92,23,6,At least there aren't any elephants in the room . . .

96,29,5,"""Table top is fine,"" you said, ""who needs a wall mount?"" Sometimes you're such a pain in the neck!"
102,22,12,We probably should have hung it on the wall.
103,25,12,With the new wide screen we can finally watch giraffe porn
74,7,1,"I've read the review, it's a steamy romance movie set in the Serengeti. Pretty much the usual thing, boy meets girl, they hold hands, fall in love... Twist is they've cast a couple of hippo's in the lead roles, think I'll get an early night, enjoy!!"
77,14,0,"Every channel cute puppies.What are we,warthogs?"
91,25,4,Spoiler alert! Only one of them makes across the river!
84,20,2,What do you need the remote control for anyway?
91,14,7,"Honey, will you please grab me a neck pillow?"
83,20,4,I told you to get a TALL screen.
82,9,4,"It may be tacky, but we have to mount it over the fireplace"
81,10,3,"You get much higher notes than those ""Voice"" contestants!"
86,25,4,Well I can see it's going to take awhile to get these spots off the couch.
73,2,2,"Sorry, Animal Planet doesn't cut it for me. We have to move."
66,2,0,"And finally sire, your cousin Solomon says you're an inspiration."
64,3,0,"Junior, I know all the cool giraffes your age have safari jeeps, but you're just not ready for one yet."
121,44,18,I was laid off from the zoo today. The only job experience I have is being looked at.
91,10,9,The elephant is in the refrigerator. So that's done.
81,15,2,How did you get in the door?
84,18,4,"Would you have imagined that one day we would watch ""Nature"" on television?"""
67,3,0,You are going to have a crick in your neck if you keep watching the RNC convention.
116,37,14,I hate the stereotyping on National Geographic.
76,7,2,Did you have problems getting through that door?
103,36,10,If you ask me these wildlife shows are all scripted.
80,10,2,"All day, it's telenovelas! You never want to go out for a drink!"
69,5,0,Now do you know why I like N.B.A. games? There are a lot of tall people.
93,23,4,It'll be neck and neck in November!
85,20,3,Must you continually binge watch Neckflix?
84,16,3,I think we need to turn the TV the other way.
90,14,6,"When you said you wanted a longneck, did you mean me and or a bottle of beer?"
98,25,8,Don't you love David Attenborough's voice.
97,30,6,"You know those aren't their real necks, they're surgically enhanced"
83,16,2,I miss 'Tarzan.'
81,14,4,I'm gonna get a beer. Want another long neck?
79,18,5,The tiny house idea was great!
76,7,2,It says here that hanging the Damocles 2000 Rex-a-nator sideways voids the manufacturer's warranty.
79,9,3,We need to turn the TV on its side - it's not tall enough
182,97,56,Noah really undersold the amenities.
81,24,0,"Sorry Love, Animal Planet isn't in our bundle."
97,29,8,They were all out of tall-screen TVs.
103,20,12,The definition is not high enough.
92,23,6,"I can't find the remote control, just use your tongue."
92,28,4,The boss said I shouldn't stick my neck out.
86,19,3,Watching 'Walking Tall' again?
66,6,0,"Wide screen, huh?"
80,19,1,Elephants! donkeys! Enough with identity politics!
76,10,1,Are you going to hog the clicker too?
91,25,4,That Marlon Perkins still cracks me up.
74,8,0,I realize we're a species of ruminant that stays close to its home range but come on!
110,29,17,Time to go outside--I hear a Land Rover coming.
80,19,0,I don’t feel comfortable with anything wider than it is tall.
189,99,63,"You know if he's elected, we're getting deported, right?"
70,4,1,A horizontal TV?!? Have you been watching pornography?
77,8,2,We bought it through Lending Tree.
73,6,1,``Now we're hiding the remote?''
91,19,5,"Wanna watch ""Animal house?"""
101,16,11,"Relax Dorothy, the people of this great country will never elect a cartoon caricature."
86,24,4,Should we maybe have it wall-mounted?
208,118,81,"You know it won't actually be an elephant and a donkey debating, right?"
103,29,12,Scooch over. I'm in a mood for some serious necking.
91,15,5,Can I have the couch? My neck hurts.
69,3,1,Probably not-- Ivanka's dress looks better with swan necks.
77,14,2,Can you rub my neck? It's stiff.
84,16,5,"When I said to book savannah, I didn't mean Georgia."
112,34,15,"I swear, whatever you're seeing on Animal Planet is a doctored video. I've never been with anyone but you."
75,8,2,TV shows the presidential race is neck and neck. We should be running since we're experts in that regard.
86,25,2,Believing her has always been a bit of a stretch for me.
129,52,21,"Harold, Tuesday is your day to be the antenna."
93,19,8,I told you the conventions were a zoo.
77,9,1,"Yes, Wes Anderson does do interesting things with head room."
102,26,9,I think it was better in portrait mode
70,8,1,Lets go out to the Savanna.
81,16,2,Why are you watching Lion King again?
76,5,2,I've been recruited by a drug cartel.
66,7,0,A spotless reputation requires a lady to keep her feet on the floor when a gentleman is present.
83,10,4,'Planet Earth'? You watch too much reality television.
89,13,6,I dropped the remote!
74,7,2,"Don't be fooled, 'a leopard can't change his spots' and neither can you!"
92,21,6,High definition has nothing to do with your neck
96,20,11,Don't pretend you weren't watching those whores from Animal Planet.
80,14,3,Don't strain your neck to get up.
84,6,5,"Well, this convention sure picked the low-lying fruit"
79,6,2,Seems like the wrong orientation for HDTV
86,18,5,"So you still want me to mount the TV, honey?"
87,19,3,Why does it always have to be donkeys and elephants?
82,8,4,Bet you his thumbs aren't even opposable.
77,11,1,"You're 17 feet high, soon 18. It's time to get off the couch and hit the Serengeti !"
98,26,8,"Wild Kingdom is hardly what I'd call ""Reality"" TV."
86,22,2,See. I knew you weren't above TV.
87,14,4,I'm done with this convention zoo
97,26,9,We should have bought the wall mount.
79,11,2,That's the last time we're using airbng.
98,31,6,"The convertible seems more practical, don't you think?"
87,19,4,"You know, all those feel-good speeches about sticking your neck out shouldn't apply to us"
75,11,2,Is it just me or are the ceilings getting lower?
68,0,1,"I know it's been a ""Long Hot Summer"" outside but you don't have to watch the reruns inside."
86,16,5,I think the manager is on to us. He asked me if I've ever heard of Wild Kingdom.
89,14,6,"Call me old fashion, but I do miss the antenna."
71,6,0,What's on the Necking Network Channel?
90,29,4,You know that those scenes in Wild Kingdom are fake
147,71,31,Spoiler alert -- the gazelle gets it.
75,11,1,"You go to the store! It's raining, and you know I can't drive with the roof down."

69,5,0,Life's a real jungle theses days mom
91,18,6,"Make some room on that couch, baby. We were born to neck."
82,9,4,I'm glad I'm up here and not down on that convention floor.
74,7,2,"I think mom hid the remote on purpose, again."
71,7,0,We should have put on the wall.
73,5,2,Wanna get neck'id and screw?
98,30,6,How did you spend your day — on sofari?
77,11,2,'When are we getting IMAX?'
90,17,8,Basketball?
146,69,33,Yes — but if he wins we'll probably be deported.
98,21,10,Don't you love Airbnb.
89,24,3,I knew we should have opted for the wall-mounted model.
82,14,4,Have you seen the remote? Losing it is a pain in the neck.
90,20,4,"Why don't they come in a vertical screen?"""
80,14,3,The neighbors are growing suspicious. We may need to raise the roof.
78,11,3,"It was the New Yorker. They wanted to know if we were voting for the elephant or the donkey. I replied, ""Option number three,"" and hung up."
78,11,2,And you think this is better than our lives at the zoo?
77,11,2,They call this big screen.
92,26,5,Thank god they chose an elephant. That could have been us on there.
68,6,0,Do you think she'll choose the Fantasy Suite?
85,11,5,I say we get rid of that thing and go back to necking on the couch?
100,32,8,I need him for president like I need a sore throat.
75,10,0,Does it look bigger on the couch?
95,19,9,"Instead of watching TV, would you rather neck?"
111,29,16,Before this election we used to think Africa was wild.
137,64,24,"Oh come on, it's only a sore throat."
66,2,0,"I do not want you to leave the room, yet."
103,40,10,You're right. We should have splurged on the sectional.
84,13,5,Care for a longneck?
76,10,1,Don't you think the high jumpers look silly?
135,67,22,Don't shoot the messenger but I think Rihanna's wearing your missing cousin.
83,18,3,Who says this isn't our natural habitat?
107,23,13,I'm tired of standing like this. Why can't we get cable like everyone else?
88,16,4,Why in Hell would they put it on the floor?

69,4,1,Want a tall neck?

95,30,7,Another kite in a tree 'emergency'....

75,7,2,I told you to buy a taller door.
82,9,3,You keep your head back there! We didn't evolve these long necks to get closer to the TV.
84,9,5,Binge watching Animal Planet does not reinforce our reputation as a smart species.
70,3,1,Burmese humans try to emulate us.
72,7,1,"Keep your head up, dear."
80,15,2,"Bingewatching ""Animal Planet"" again?"
73,4,2,It's time to go to the Convention!

84,19,3,A first-class upgrade. . . good old Noah.
77,6,2,Talk about sticking your neck out!
73,4,1,"Did the children take a trip to the zoo, or in the zoo?"
127,47,22,"let's eat out tonight, honey. How about Central Park?"
115,41,16,"Wide screen, flat screen, but they never got around to making a tall screen."
115,34,16,"Got it. When they go low we go high. But, when they go high, then what do we do?"
82,9,4,"I agree, watching humans in their normal habitat can be uplifting."

166,64,49,Another name for couch potato is lion steak.
86,22,3,"You're right, it's time for us to start our own political party."
76,14,0,"Carefull, watching too much TV can cause neck strain."
80,20,3,"OK, so we'll move it back above the fireplace."

99,29,7,Giraffic Park again?
80,10,2,"Oh, sure, if it weren't for our ancestors breaking through the grass ceiling all those generations ago, we wouldn't live as we do. So why do I still feel there should be more to evolve to than this?"

81,10,2,"Don't boo, vote!"
73,4,1,Hold your fire
90,25,3,Sometimes I feel like we're vertical in a horizontal world.
102,25,11,"If the idiot installed it sideways, he should come back and do it right!"
91,17,6,"Yes, but the wall will mean that we're ALL in a zoo!"
101,25,11,I still like it better in portrait mode.
78,12,2,"No son, I won't leave your father for Richard Attenborough."
83,13,4,They call THAT high-definition?
111,46,13,They talk about low hanging fruit as if that was easy.
124,45,22,The kids are finally asleep. Are you up for a little necking?
76,9,2,"*whatever sound we make, but communicating ""get a job""*"

103,40,7,Maybe we could rotate it 90 degrees.
70,3,1,I hate how all the news sound bites are getting so short.
119,58,14,"Why when I was your age, I would have been outside enjoying the fresh air, fleeing from ravenous predators."
102,29,11,Please don't tell me the Republicans are talking about lowering ceilings again.

95,34,6,"""I've been searching high and low for the clicker""."
86,18,5,No wonder your posture is so bad.
75,13,1,The picture is spotty.
83,26,2,"If PBS is over your head, try Animal Planet."
88,18,5,"Not ""Wild Kingdom"" again! Why can't you just leave work at the office?"
76,6,1,"Darling, I told you already: ""The Redneck National Convention will not address any of the daily challenges faced by middle-class people in our condition."""
67,2,0,Don't worry. One day you'll grow enough to graduate from being a grass muncher to a leaf aficionado just like me.
113,43,15,We better go before the people get back. They will not be happy about their ficus plant.
133,68,22,Big deal—we break ceilings all the time.
81,15,3,"If you can't raise the screen, can you turn it vertically?"
98,40,6,"I tell you babe, it's a zoo out there."
90,10,8,"Hey, that's my spot!!"
77,9,2,"So, honey, is the National Geographic channel still over-programming short-necked creatures?"
69,1,1,Who could see any TV with you sitting there. Cover yourself. Your spotpattern is reflecting on the screen.
114,30,17,Neckflix tonight?
81,11,3,I'm going to stick my neck out.
82,14,3,I TOLD you we should've asked more questions about this place instead of assuming that Congo autocorrected to condo.
88,16,7,"""That ToysRUs trust fund won't last forever ya know."
63,1,0,Wanna make some little horsies?
76,10,1,It's may appeal to you but becoming domesticated appals me.
92,24,6,"Animal Planet! Have they gotten to that ""husbandry"" part yet?"
86,12,5,Why are New Yorker cartoons always based on non sequitur illustrations?
87,25,4,What a mess. Maybe the Green Party needs a mascot.
74,16,1,I really stuck my neck out for you.
83,22,2,"Don't worry, the technician is coming back to turn the screen like it should be."
83,13,2,"You know, we had to pull our necks in to get this place, but it's worth it."
122,51,15,I believe that you have my spot.
94,26,6,I'm going to the store for beer--we're out of long-necks.
78,11,2,It's all elephants and donkeys with you.

212,179,82,What's happened to us Marge.. we used to be so wild?
73,12,1,"Instead of watching all that stuff, you should be out on the Serengeti making it a better world."
101,27,9,Now I suppose he's going to ban all mammalians coming out of Africa.
88,16,7,Be honest - does this room make my neck look too long?
101,28,10,Management called me in today. They feel I'm always looking down on others.
89,18,6,"Are you watching ""America's Necks Top Model?"""
100,32,8,"You'll see, it's our turn now. People are really sick to death of elephants and donkeys."
116,30,16,They're sending a primate to change the channel between noon and five.
187,126,58,I would have been home earlier --I got stuck in the tunnel.
78,13,2,"Don't worry, Geoffrey, you'll work again. How long could this internet fad last?"
77,7,2,"Okay, so you're not elephant or donkey, but you'll be an ass if you just sit this one out."
95,18,10,Trump cannot deport us; we are an endangered species.
87,21,4,I'll sit over there so we can neck.
86,23,3,No thanks. The Discovery Channel gives me nightmares.
84,7,6,Duh?! Donkeys and Elephants will never represent us!
70,7,2,Watch PBS and be more.
82,15,3,That door frame is ruining my neckline.

133,58,25,"The baby is down for the night...most of him, anyway."
80,13,2,How do you think these reality show participants would survive in the real world?
90,17,6,Why don't you get outside and play Pokemon Go like all the other kids?
74,6,1,"Honey, you know how I feel about craning my neck to see the television."
105,43,8,I'm telling you that Nat Geo is scripted.
77,10,1,We look better on cell phones.
92,22,5,Don't sit too far from the TV. It's bad for your neck.
70,5,0,"Come on show some desire show some innovation stick your neck out a bit change the channel , change the world then we can talk about a remote!"

86,18,3,My legs hurt...we need to buy an antenna.
98,24,10,Could you grab me a long neck?
80,12,2,"They're coming! Quick, flatten like a throw blanket!"
79,9,3,"I agree. There just aren't that many good giraffe movies, but what can we do about it?"
77,12,3,You didn't tell me David Attenborough was on!
71,9,1,I never knew how much I'd miss President Dumbo.
80,12,2,I'll share the remote when you share the couch!
91,17,6,"When that show's over, maybe we could go out and graze some trees, get a little exercise."
79,16,2,The wide screen just doesn't work for me.
72,4,1,"Well, the same reason our necks got so long."
70,5,0,Why is it that I'm always the one who has to go downstairs to watch TV?
96,18,10,I hate FOX News more than Cheetah News
75,10,0,"Hellooo, giraffing the sofa again!"
88,23,5,"No, we weren't represented at either convention."
74,11,3,I've always admired your plunging neckline.
70,5,0,I'm old enough to remember when the only giraffes on TV were in travelogues.
98,33,6,"Next place, I vote for vaulted ceilings."
96,22,6,Quit watching those animal kingdom reruns and pay some attention to me for a change.
102,27,10,We were lucky to find a pre-war apartment with high ceilings.
67,5,0,"Honey, you've been watching 'Savanna Hunters International' for six hours straight."
67,3,0,"Uh, could you scooch over, and didn't I say that screen should be raised higher?"
76,9,1,I really wish you would put your head back into the clouds.
96,25,7,Thank god Airbnb now lets you filter by ceiling height.
92,14,6,I love his forelocks.
95,27,7,Have you thought of rotating the sceen 90 degrees?
82,18,4,I promise we'll get a tallscreen next week.
111,17,18,"No, I'm not high."
74,8,1,"No, not another rerun of Animal Kingdom?"
78,7,3,"How did we get here, Abigail?"
109,28,14,"Not ""Out of Africa"" again?"
73,7,1,"You are obsessed with ZNN, the Zoo News Network!"
84,19,4,"Dude, I already told you, just because they're called Fox News doesn't mean they're an animal friendly station"
74,6,1,"Honey, why don't we give that neck reduction cream a try?"
90,14,6,Would you like to watch a documentary about human evolution?
72,8,0,I woke up with a very sore throat!
71,6,2,"Babe, I'm the only Bachelor you'll ever need."
69,1,0,No wonder your eyes are tired. Giraffes don't have fingers and can't turn the TV off.
93,19,7,The toilet is out of water again...
110,42,12,"My favorite movie -- ""Get Shorty.'"
76,7,2,"Sorry, Bernie. That's not what I'd call a full-throated endorsement."
80,7,3,Stop your moping. Just be glad you're not a donkey or an elephant.
86,14,5,I see I missed the boat. 'Noah' was just on.
77,12,2,It is a tall order
85,13,5,"""I wish they'd make these TVs vertical""."
90,22,4,"Honey, we're totally out of acacia chips."
72,8,3,I thought I asked you to wash your feet .
81,13,3,You look a lot more comfortable now that the elephant's left.
76,8,2,"I auditioned for The Bachelor, but they said I was too tall."
90,23,4,You're so obsessed with people shows.
68,5,0,I need a chiropractor for a a spine readjustment.
80,8,5,"I used to look up to you and admire your lofty goals, but now you just sit around watching reruns of ""The Young and the Neckless""."
90,25,5,"I know the rent's ridiculously high, but it's so hard to find a pre-war building with these high ceilings."
109,30,14,Have you heard from Noah?
102,20,11,Your selfies would look much better in portrait mode.
86,13,5,Aren't you outraged that all TV screens are horizontally over- represented?
89,17,5,A cathedral ceiling only goes so far.
75,14,1,A cup of hot coffee is already cold by the time it reaches my stomach. That's interesting.
85,12,5,Honey do you think we will ever get past necking?
78,4,4,"Hey babe, how ‘bout you and me do some necking during the Jack Hanna Animal Adventure show?"

159,80,40,It's over your head.
79,11,3,My neck hurts - we need to mount the t.v. higher.
104,25,11,"You're right, wide-screen doesn't do anything for me either."
75,9,1,"You're right, it's too low. I'll call the Geek Squad tomorrow."
73,6,1,I'm glad we don't live in a car.
82,16,2,"Look Marge, I think I'm gonna go down to the waterin' hole and slap necks with the guys."
94,21,7,"I said high-screen, you were the one who insisted on widescreen."
76,3,2,"Honey, can I PLEASE get a Lazy Boy now?"
77,11,2,Does that couch give you a crick in the neck?
75,13,2,"Hey, he won the nomination. Not everyone looks down on him."
80,7,2,"Don't worry, she'll win."
77,13,1,At least the elephants have it worse than us this year.
110,40,16,"Don't watch that, it's way over your head."
83,17,2,Mutual of Omaha again?

111,42,10,"I know it's better on the big screen, but we're not welcome in the theater anymore."
108,43,11,This could be our year - everyone's fed up with the donkeys and elephants.
88,27,2,It's a real zoo out there.
84,21,2,How about we mount it up on the wall?
93,17,7,Now maybe you'll believe me when I tell you it's a jungle out there.
74,10,1,"For the thousandth time, I agree it would have served us better if they'd oriented it the other way, but there's not much we can do about it now, is there?"
91,21,8,"Of course I appreciate the new ceiling, but what about the problem with the door."
103,30,11,You can reach the cobwebs too you know. Just sayin'.
94,23,6,We need to get that mounted.
79,14,2,How many times can you watch these Animal Planet reruns?
89,19,5,I can't believe it has only been a year since Trump won the US Presidential election which lead to the end of the human race. To think that we used to live in a jungle...
87,24,2,I don't mean to look down on you.
67,1,0,"But honey, Wednesday is my night to choose."
82,14,4,Rotate your screen 90 degrees for the optimal viewing experience.
104,34,9,Animal Planet? Seriously?
85,16,4,I am really hoping they will be surprised to see us.
107,34,11,Seriously? You really think you need the remote control?

79,9,2,"""Let's get out today ....... How about a visit to the zoo"" ?"
87,12,6,I can't believe those TV commercials for sore throat lozenges.
147,66,34,It's called Deep Throat.
76,13,2,There's a surcharge for using the baby pool but breakfast is all vegetarian.
76,9,1,Did you the hear the Tigers accorded the street just got on the endangered species list? They're always showing off.
88,27,4,"I know you don't need it, but I still would like to find the channel changer."
85,19,4,Watching yourself on Nature again?
74,9,1,"Be patient, honey... Lamarck was right. Portrait oriented TV screens are going to hit the market soon."
81,13,3,"Wow, 70"" isn't really that big."
95,19,8,It's times like this that I'm glad I'm not a donkey or an elephant.
125,59,18,Let me adjust the vertical.
77,9,2,Turn off that garbage and switch it back to Animal Planet.
95,35,4,"I trimmed the trees, dear."
89,21,5,I'm going to stick my neck out and suggest we buy a stand.

67,3,0,"Are you are so tired, you need to lie down to sleep?"
80,10,3,Poor elephants.

94,27,6,And you had to save the 60 bucks on the wall mount...
69,6,0,Trump's Ark has a flatscreen! DVR of yesterday's Inauguration or breaking news on the nuke war that started this morning?
76,8,1,"See, I told you elephants and donkeys are bad influences."
91,21,6,"Very nice purchase dear, but how the hell are we going to use a remote?"
68,9,0,Why are you peeved? I always stick out my neck for you.
101,22,13,You do know it's not really about an elephant and a donkey.
98,22,9,Move over Baby and let's 'Neck'.
85,16,4,I think she stretched the truth.
86,16,6,The cooking channel is not what I meant by 'more domesticated.'
115,46,15,Wall-mounted might be better.
88,19,4,"Let me guess, you're watching Animal Planet."
90,20,5,"Nothing but sex, violence, and reality shows. You really should stop watching the Wilderness Channel."

77,8,2,It's a jungle out there on the news channel.
80,10,2,The TV Guy is bringing the stilts on Tuesday.

77,12,1,I thought the love seat was meant for us to cuddle.
74,9,0,"It's basically a dream or purgatory or something. C'mon, let's go outside and slam our necks together."
70,5,0,Venti or Trenta?
89,15,7,"Entertaining, yeah - but so low brow."
78,14,1,Maybe these zoo upgrades weren't a good idea.
73,9,0,You've got to stop watching Nat Geo Wild. The Wildabeast ALWAYS losses.
76,9,2,"Look, no one in their right mind would call you a couch potato, so don't worry about it."

127,68,20,"Looking down on everyone, yes. Condescending, no."
102,23,12,"Well, the kids are at camp. Wanna neck?"
96,16,10,But if we went to the game we would be able to see.
79,9,4,"I can't believe we're breaking because you're jealous of a little girl who fed me acacia twigs. It's a zoo out there, Linda; it is just part of the job."
77,6,2,Would you like a long-neck bottle of beer?
95,21,7,How about we install the tv stand today?
111,43,15,I'm overextended

76,5,3,Let's hope FIOS doesn't follow through with those break-neck speeds
76,14,0,The camera does add 100 pounds.
85,21,3,Frankly I think Discovery Channel has a distinct anti-herbivore bias
116,22,19,I told you not to watch the convention. Those people are animals.
73,8,1,We need to raise the tv. Hang it on the wall. Something!
83,21,2,Don't you think the screen should be rotated 90 degrees?
86,13,6,Since you got fired by Toy's R Us all you do is lay around and binge watch Netflix all day.
75,8,1,I fed up with Pachyderms and Jackasses. I think it's time for the Jiraffe party
96,25,6,"Give it up, Geoffrey. They stopped showing your commercials long ago."
105,35,10,Out of Africa?
76,9,2,The doors are locked. Do you really need to see if the lion is asleep?

119,56,18,Again with 'The Lion King'?
68,3,0,"Your'e watching the zoo channel again, aren't you?"
115,42,15,Lean over and change it yourself.
88,18,5,All you ever want to do is sit around and neck.
84,13,4,I bet you're sitting on the remote again!
73,11,0,Because (a) I don't do sitting yoga and (b) you're taking up the whole couch.
86,19,3,I still think we should have mounted it on the wall!
74,10,0,The Geographic Channel is the only thing worth watching.

77,12,3,Really? Keeping up with the Giraffians?....Again?
89,19,6,I think you've got the screen turned the wrong way.
109,40,12,"Time to move, the zoo knows where we live."
98,34,7,I don't care how many predators are out there. You need fresh air.
101,32,8,Let's go out tonight for a movie and rile up the couple seated behind us.
116,45,13,Those gutters aren't going to clean themselves!
88,12,6,"Perhaps an awkward question, but might you be interested in a little necking?"
78,15,1,Don't you think we could have used a bigger screen.
89,14,6,You really do miss Marlin Perkins.
122,47,18,Back in my day we actually had to stretch our necks out to change the channel.
92,13,8,"Why not? There's a lot of money in an ear, nose and throat practice."
90,31,3,You'd think vertical screen TV's would be a thing by now.
96,24,9,You can stop looking. I swallowed the remote.
82,17,3,"This is not my idea of a ""high-rise"" apartment!"

77,9,1,Aren't you tired of watching Animal Kingdom reruns?
103,34,10,"OK, I've painted the ceilings, cleaned the gutters, and pruned the trees. Do you have something less stereo-typical left for me to do?"
87,21,4,"I keep telling you, there is no remote. Just lean over and change channels with your nose."
93,30,4,Have you considered IMAX?
80,15,1,You have had enough real housewives of the serengetti
64,3,0,I wish
101,31,8,"I'm going to pour myself a tall, stiff drink."
81,13,3,It's so depressing! No matter what channel I put on I hear about new walls and fences! We may as well be back at the zoo!
90,16,7,"You know that ""Real Housewives of the Savannah"" is scripted, don't you?"
92,24,5,"How many times can you watch ""Giraffic Park""?"
105,30,8,"It's a jungle out there, Marge."
89,18,5,You are a real pain in the neck.
118,43,15,Ever think the TV should be portrait and not landscape?
84,10,4,Even I find his ideas a reach.
83,16,4,Any tall tales on tonight?
88,8,7,Did you order Ethiopian take-out?
68,3,0,"Don't pout, I didn't mean it in a bad way when I said you had are giraffe neck."
83,14,3,Would you get me a long neck Miller beer while you're up ?
81,9,3,Call it what you will Gissel but the elephants don't get all the crappy roles...just us giraffes.
95,18,8,Can you believe how bright his spots look in HD?
107,37,11,Do you know anything about the neighbor’s missing tree?
88,16,5,"You are wasting your life watching TV, you are so smart, head and shoulders above your class."
92,29,4,Get your feet off of the couch
74,14,0,We need a larger sofa.
136,79,24,"Yes, I miss Africa, but not enough to give up air conditioning."
68,6,1,Raise the screen so it will really be hi- def
67,2,0,"If you can't find the remote, YOU get up to change the channel."
89,20,5,"Are you watching your old Toys ""R"" Us commercials again?"
105,36,8,I'm going back to the zoo. I'd rather be a caged animal than a couched potato.
79,15,1,I think we should go with the ranch house.
100,30,7,Why don't you get outside and stretch your legs.
82,17,2,Your definition of necking is different than mine.
90,19,6,"Can I bring you another longneck, honey?"
78,14,1,Didn't she tell you a hundred times to keep your feet off the sofa!
71,8,0,"Don't get so excited, the movie's not about us. It's the ""George Raft Story."""
77,14,0,"Listen Junior, I am not sticking my neck out to get you an audition on Animal Planet"
98,26,7,Do these elephants and donkeys know everyone's watching them?
105,39,8,Hi honey. Work was a total zoo again.
104,28,12,Thank God we aren't a political symbol.
81,13,3,"Oh please, stripes always make you look vulnerable"
76,12,0,I'm waiting for Jeffrey to come on.
68,3,1,Get off you high horse.
78,11,3,"Chill, babycakes. We'll stay here four years if the elephants win."
77,13,2,I'm not angry; just hitting the roof
78,15,0,"I'm glad they chose an elephant for a mascot, not a giraffe."
84,19,5,"It's time we face the elephant in the room, Fred."
80,15,3,Let's turn the t.v. off and neck!

94,22,6,Can we please watch something other than 'Real Housewives of the Serengeti' tonight?
123,34,23,"First, I told you to stop watching those gory nature shows. Second, is it anyone we know?"
134,38,27,We have to talk about the elephant in the room.
68,17,2,It will always be a donkey and elephant show.
65,4,0,Would you mind wearing the headphones?
106,42,11,Noah said he will give us a discount if we pay up front for the 40 nights.
79,5,4,hello
84,17,3,Enough TV. How about we just stretch out together?
88,12,6,Let's just sit around and neck.
79,15,0,"I'm going to work. If you can pull yourself away from the TV and get to the grocery store, were almost out of acacia leaves."
107,38,12,I nailed that “hump day” audition; then they go and give the commercial to some camel.
93,30,5,"I don't want to be a nag, but I really wish you wouldn't put your hooves on the sofa."
96,22,1,We look better in HD.
134,41,29,"I don't think ""Necrophilia"" means what you think it means."
68,5,0,Does the internet really need more giraffes?
78,14,1,I liked our zoo better.
116,51,12,"Besides, you know the camera adds five feet."
72,4,2,Didn't we already watch this episode of Next Top Leaf?
79,13,4,Let's order in. That door's giving me fits.
96,25,8,Your getting spots all over the couch.

80,10,3,"No, you cannot skip Safari School to watch ""Katching Up With The Kangaroos."""
95,23,6,I am trying to learn something about Africa in case Trump becomes the next president
69,3,0,Did you use a mouse to turn it on?
82,10,5,"It's our favorite horror film, Neckrophilia."
86,17,5,At least we could see over the wall
168,65,52,You need to write Noah and thank him for the upgrade.
73,7,0,If you were from Jersey like me I would point out that we don't need electricity. My tongue is two feet long.
88,30,5,I can't be the only one bringing home the Acacia around here.
93,28,6,You shouldn't have hidden the cookies on top of the refrigerator.
149,69,32,"The doctor said get rest, drink lots of tea, and that sore throat will be gone in a year."
101,29,9,"Honey, why is the TV sideways?"
82,9,4,"I don't think you're supposed to binge whole seasons on Netflix in one sitting with an anatomy like ours, is all."
93,19,6,I'm going to stick my neck out and suggest we watch Human Kingdom.
90,28,4,Please don't stoop down to their level.
78,9,3,The safari camps were booked.
90,11,8,"I've had it, the ergonomics of this apartment are just a pain in the neck."
87,18,4,"No! I cannot reach it, myself!"
108,38,11,Again with the hoofs on the upholstery!
68,3,0,"Believe me, I am not cheating on you."
70,9,0,"Honey, even though we live in Great Neck,NY, cozying up and necking with you is a tall order."
126,53,22,Why the long face?
82,10,5,I wish these donkeys and elephants could see things from our view.
73,2,1,hey bro
108,29,13,Are you just grazing the channels?
78,7,3,How long do short necks take to evolve?
126,38,19,"Just once I want to hear someone say, ""Even-toed ungulate lives matter""."
87,20,5,I thought we agreed to mount the TV above the fireplace!
91,11,7,R.N.C.? I thought this was Animal Planet!
76,10,2,"If you make some room on the couch, we can indulge in some sweet, sweet necking."
79,14,3,Are you kidding me? They chose an elephant and a donkey over us?
76,13,0,"I can deal with the lower ceiling, but it's the single 6 ft. bed that's a game changer."
71,8,0,Move over a bit so we can neck while watching tv.
104,24,11,Again and again I told you...get tall screen TV not wide screen TV.
83,20,2,Are you binge watching Tarzan movies again?
137,52,27,Can't you find anything else to do all day besides sitting and watching the gnus?
70,5,0,I have a big thumb texting issue.
87,13,5,All this NBA talk has gone straight to your head.
96,24,7,I still say a ceiling fan would have kept the room a lot cooler.
88,16,6,I checked the fridge. We have some longnecks.
92,13,7,I don't care if it's 4K! It cuts everyone's heads off!
71,4,1,The RNC and DNC were sold to GNC.
69,4,0,Oh my aching neck! You really should of had the TV wall mounted.
72,8,0,This is exciting - he's neither elephant nor donkey!
77,10,1,Be nice if they made these TVs in a vertical leterbox format!
75,10,1,"You miss the fresh acacia leaves, don't you?"
73,9,1,"I know you'd miss your shows and the heat is a killer, but we've got a contract, and the kids expect to see two giraffes at the zoo. So come on! They'll put ice blocks in the pool."
71,3,2,You'd better plan to shift over and make room for me if you expect me to make the popcorn!
87,18,4,I prefer the Portrait orientation rather than the Landscape one.
77,20,0,"I told you to get the vertical screen, not the horizontal one. But did you listen? So now you have to choose what we watch: heads or tails."
90,13,7,"When I asked the super for warning signs reading ""duck,"" he laughed like a hyena."
78,11,4,I don't care if it's the nature channel.
81,10,4,"If you want to stick your neck out, then tell them to vote their conscience."
87,15,5,"Well if he's going to build a wall to keep us out, it better to be a pretty high wall."
86,12,4,Really? The necked channel again?
78,14,3,You still watching the debates? Neither of them is addressing our issues.
88,14,5,"How quaint, the elephants are called Republicans, and donkeys are called Democrats."
87,16,5,"Sure they make wide-screen TVs, but why don't they make tall-screen TVs?"
69,6,0,Where have I been? I've been out running with a bad crowd of lions.
84,14,3,"Darling, turn off the T.V., and let's neck."
79,10,4,I had a few twigs for lunch and fixed the signal problem.
122,50,21,"Have you seen my good tie? You know, the long one?"
74,12,0,I didn't fit in at the elephant or the donkey's parties'
77,10,2,"Do be serious, dear, he's an uncouth wild animal!"
106,37,9,There are just no decent parts for giraffes anymore.
101,30,8,I've never seen you this low
72,7,1,Watching movies at home is so much easier.
102,18,13,I think a wide screen discriminates against us.
91,25,4,I told you we should have mounted it.
100,27,8,Our neighbor complains we have a tendency to look down on him.
80,2,5,I stand corrected; the sword is mightier than the pen.
98,40,4,Wide-screen... I just don't see the appeal.
89,14,7,How did they get the TV through the door?
78,11,2,The olympics will really be neck and neck this year.
104,32,9,"""I couldn't get it in Vertical Format""."
65,4,0,Say something funny.
207,168,72,"No, I mean literally, I shattered the glass ceiling."
92,23,6,They're featuring Uncle Jeff on tonight's episode of Wild Kingdom.
77,5,3,i caught our neighbors skinny-dipping again.
97,21,9,Are you watching the game in Tall Definition?
86,20,4,Good for you! Three weeks of taking it easy is the best thing for a sore throat.
119,36,18,"And how do you propose I ""pick up the remote?"""
82,18,1,I think the show you are watching is way over even your head.
75,10,2,Ok- it's a tough job market. But there still has to be a demand for the only song and dance team like us.
87,10,5,"You know, life on the plain isn't really narrated by David Attenborough."
92,18,7,Where's that light bulb you wanted replaced?
100,40,8,"'When they go low, we go high.' I like that."
80,18,0,How many times have I told you that we need a taller entertainment center!
75,10,1,Maybe you can scoot over a bit?
77,5,3,It's not our cable subscription. Marlin Perkins has been off the air for thirty years.
161,49,42,How could we have let David Attenborough talk us into mating on camera?
92,27,4,"Son, do something with your life. You can reach higher than this."
69,7,0,Are you watching your favorite shows again?
106,38,10,I didn't think witness relocation would be like this.
87,23,3,I would have made that Olympic team if I could only dribble.
88,20,4,"Actually, this is high definition."
74,4,2,"Ugh, when you swallowed the remote you left us with these endless shopping networks!"
93,23,7,"I wish someone, for once, would make a tall-screen TV"
90,13,8,"Oh I have seen this episode, the leopard catches Geoffrey."
93,24,4,Told you we should have mounted it above the fireplace.
117,27,26,Turn the TV off and let's talk about the elephant in the other room.
81,11,3,We shouldn't neck while my parents are in the next room.
101,34,7,"Yes, you're tall enough, but how's your dribbling?"
81,21,1,It's so much better since you fixed the vertical hold.
88,13,6,"Yes, that's how they neck."
73,7,1,"I just registered a complaint about the doors, but - Good news! There's a resident chiropractor..."
78,9,2,"Speaking of tall tales, Hillary continues to claim she neither 'sent' nor 'received' any classified emails!"
87,16,3,I just don't get what's supposed to be so great with widescreen format?
76,11,1,Is this the only thing you can't do standing up?
114,44,14,Don't watch that show with the lions. It doesn't end well.
89,21,4,You were home all day and didn't clean up; we can't keep living like animals!
97,19,10,Could I interest you in MY forty-eight-inch display?
84,15,3,"""We could go shopping the lions are away for the weekend.'"
147,61,36,"If they say the Presidential race is neck and neck one more time, I'm going to scream!"
89,23,3,"It's called ergonomics, Harold. Mount it already!"
91,30,3,Mounting the TV would solve all of our problems.
81,20,2,Didn't I tell you not to watch Lion Week
84,15,3,"If you fall asleep out here, you'll wake up with a sore you-know-what."
66,1,0,"World wrestling entertainment along with its iconography trumps soap opera, right?!"
84,10,4,"See, it's good you didn't get that job as the GOP mascot."
81,12,3,"You have to stop watching Animal Planet, and go out and see for yourself."
87,14,5,I still say you're too tall for Project Runway.
85,18,4,Let me know if you want that moved up a little higher.
79,15,1,Seriously... a wall?
79,12,3,I oppose the media's unrealistic standards of neck length.
101,20,12,"Get that dreamy look off your face, Olivia. He's only got 95 spots! You want your kids to look like Holsteins?!"
81,8,4,"If you want mimosa buds for dessert, you can darn well pluck them yourself."
83,16,3,Maybe it's stiff because you slept wrong!
81,13,4,Don't you think we're underrepresented in the industry?
67,2,1,"Its the food channel, they wanted me to be on it."
251,160,117,We need to talk about the elephant in the other room.
67,4,1,Still watching that nature documentary about giraffes?
93,17,9,Do you remember the first time we necked ?
70,3,1,HD Really shows our most distinctive feature: our spots
83,10,5,"Let's watch it together and neck a little, too."
81,14,3,No more long Neckflix binges for you.
126,41,23,I just told the neighbor we were from Savannah.
114,44,14,And you thought YOU'D be the one to break the glass ceiling?
83,12,4,"We talked about this, Harold - no shoes on the couch."
92,23,6,How in the world did we get in here?
85,11,5,Let's watch 'Up'.
82,10,4,It's time we take over the donkey and elephant.
90,20,6,"I thought you wanted a neck, flicks & chill evening."
107,32,14,Maybe if we turned it on its side...
109,33,12,"Oh no, not 'Out of Africa' again!"
83,17,3,It's not fair that only Ostriches are allowed to bury their heads in the sand
86,24,4,We should've asked for vaulted ceilings in EVERY room.
84,15,3,"For the last time, can I please hang this over the mantle?"
75,8,2,Ever wonder what our pixel count is?
78,7,2,"Alexa, tell my TV to change the channel to Animal Planet."
69,3,0,Sorry Hon ... We're all out of Bud Longneck.
81,17,1,Perhaps a model with a vertical orientation would work better for us.
100,13,12,"For the last time, don’t change the channel with your tongue."
92,24,5,Don't you think it is a bit stupid to watch a contest between an elephant and a donkey?
148,50,35,He now says the wall is going to be twenty feet high and the lions are going to pay for it.
104,28,12,You're watching the Lion King?
193,122,66,"No, I mean I shattered an actual glass ceiling."
85,11,5,What would be so wrong with a 9 x 16 aspect ratio?
98,35,7,And you wonder why you have a stiff neck.
70,6,1,Still glad you bought the horizontal screen that was on sale?
77,15,0,You know it's not just your neck you're lowering .
71,11,0,Can we switch from Animal Planet to ESPN now?
95,22,7,"HiDef doesn't refer to height, dear"
77,9,1,This is perfect drone's-eye view. Just the way I like it!
68,5,0,You could've helped me with that elephant...
77,11,2,"I've told you, dear, you need to adjust the aspect-ratio."
82,14,3,A third party candidate? You are being ridiculous. The elephant may be taller than the donkey but it can still be the biggest ass.
89,20,5,Hooves off the couch!
92,30,4,"You know, Janice, I stuck my neck out to get you that interview."
76,7,2,"""The 'Legume Channel Network' again? Seriously?"
94,29,4,that can't be good for your posture
110,40,12,We used to use that couch for necking . . .
68,3,1,"If you believe the harness is real, it will be."
68,3,1,What's streaming?
90,24,6,Wanna watch a movie and neck like we used to?
121,49,19,"Jimmy's in bed, let's watch Wild Kingdom."
63,0,1,"Bad news, sire, the chosen one's hands are too small."
124,44,25,"I don't think we can be referred to as ""wildlife"" anymore."
111,24,17,I don't work all day so you can sit around and watch NeckFlix.
79,15,1,When are these donkeys and elephants going to learn how to connect with the rest of us?
90,23,6,Maybe if the screen was positioned vertically?
76,6,2,"You really ought to stop moping around, and keep your head held high."
122,47,19,I still feel uncomfortable renting this Airbnb from a lion.
91,24,6,Still think we should have gone with the wall mount.
75,10,0,Why do you waste your time on that low leaf eater waste land?
111,36,14,This year it's hard to identify with either party.
89,23,4,Are the candidates neck and neck?
106,42,11,You know the shows on Animal Planet are completely fake; all the animals are actors.
78,10,2,Quit roominating!
89,18,4,"""Running neck and neck"" gets old, Shirl, really old."
102,26,11,I don't care what you think. It's ALL low-hanging fruit.
65,2,1,"""I""ll watch with you, ponce someone like us gets more recognition""."
90,14,6,No we don't need to order the Little Giant Ladder.
73,8,0,Do you really think this is the best way to stop looking into the neighbor's yard?
91,14,10,Do you want to neck during the movie?
83,12,3,You don't always have to stick your neck out.
112,34,13,"You can watch TV with your boyfriend, but no necking."
106,31,12,"I have to admit, I miss the Bronx."
105,35,10,If you watch too much TV you'll stunt your growth
75,9,1,Do you not have a leg to stand on?
81,13,3,I still prefer the leopard skin sofa.
76,9,1,"Yes, I love the doorway...but my neck doesn't."
69,3,1,I keep telling you that the screen has to be higher so I won't get a sore neck!
80,8,3,I ate the last bagel.
181,103,56,"You know her spots are surgically enhanced, right?"
70,9,0,"I told you to only watch ""G"" rated programs and feet off the couch!"
102,27,10,Don't complain about your sore neck. I told you we needed the wall mount.
72,4,2,I told you there really is no use for a television as a quadruped.
71,6,1,"I love and support you, but I am struggling to adjust to this whole naturism thing..."
87,17,4,Noah said he's building another ark. Turn off the tv. We've got to go.
70,7,1,The Bachelorette again? Which one is that cow necking with now?
76,10,1,I wish we had a top-to-bottom screen instead of this side-to-side.
128,47,24,"When they go low, we go high."
92,32,5,"Well, aren't you glad now they chose the donkey and the elephant?"
191,78,63,"I got a weird text from a ""Noah""."
101,26,10,"Just because they're acting like a bunch of wild animals, doesn't mean we have to."
95,18,8,I told you not to watch Animal Planet before bed.
73,10,2,Want to try Pokemon GO tonight?
85,20,3,Even PBS Nature programs are never completely accurate.
103,30,11,We should have bought a long-screen TV.
69,1,1,Would you please turn the channel.
104,33,10,Trump banned us yet?
91,13,7,I think we should mount it!
92,29,5,You don't need the remote control.
82,14,3,Aren't you tired of watching Animal Planet yet?
81,14,2,They don't even eat the rose Marge.
86,19,5,A long day at the office.
71,5,0,Don't tell me you're still watching little Donald.
76,13,1,I can't believe you're watching that Zebra channel again.
137,55,30,We can't keep ignoring the elephant in the other room.
108,30,13,Anything good on neck-flix?
96,22,8,"Well, if I were running for President, I wouldn't stick my neck out so much."
91,21,6,Why don't we turn it off and neck a little?
88,18,4,Is that a rerun of People Kingdom?
85,20,2,"Going on safaris, son, is something people used to do in the old country."
86,17,5,I am tired of the media saying that the candidates are neck and neck.
79,8,2,"Shark Week, darling?"
90,16,7,Configuring an ergonomically correct monitor height is a pain in the neck.
79,9,3,You're becoming a couch zucchini
97,21,8,They say TV hurts your eyes but this one is killing my neck!
129,52,25,"His father's from Kenya, you know?"
