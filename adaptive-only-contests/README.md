These experiments only have an adaptive algorithm choosing queries. This means
that it makes a choice to show which captions to show based on previous
captions.

These contests don't have any comparison -- we don't know how much better the
adaptive approach is.

This data is not suitable for any scientific process that relies on independence
of each trial -- participant 1 can influence what participant 1000 sees.

The adaptive algorithms are designed to select the funniest caption out of all
the caption.
