These experiments only have an adaptive algorithm choosing queries. This means
that it makes a choice to show which captions to show based on previous
captions.

These contests don't have any comparison -- we don't know how much better the
adaptive approach is.

I am putting this data online to provide more data. Given a choice, I would use
the data present in the other contests first.

It possible to create a "pseudo-random algorithm" from an adaptive only
contests (by ignoring many samples and only going with minimum number of
samples found on any caption).
