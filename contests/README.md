`random+adaptive`: both random and adaptive experiments were performed. These
experiments were performed initially; there are less experiments and less
responses.

`adaptive`: These experiments use an adaptive algorithm. This algorithm has
theoretical guarantees to find the funniest caption. It depends on previous
inputs.

Descriptions of the adaptive/non-adaptive can be found in `../README.md` (one
level higher) in the section "Collection schemes". Additionally, we describe
the adaptive algorithm in `adaptive/README.md`.
