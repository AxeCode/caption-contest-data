We publish summary stats for each contest. These summary stats include every
caption and how often it was rated funny/unfunny/somewhat funny.

i.e., we use the below file for each algorithm with the experiment.

```csv
Rank,Score,Precision,Unfunny,Somewhat funny,Funny,Caption
0,2.3,0.03,49,20,1,Hey look, a wild caption!
1,2.1,0.04,0,0,100,The perfect caption
...
```

These files are generated by `summary-stats.py` from
`participant-responses.csv` in each experiment. We then generate an Excel file
from these sheets.

### Calculation of score and precision
The three buttons "unfunny", "somewhat funny" and "funny" are mapped to rewards
1, 2 and 3 respectively.

To calculate the score, we calculate the mean precision, `sum(rewards) / n`
when we have `n` responses.

To calculate the precision, we need the reward squared: if the user gives us a
reward of "2", the reward squared is "4". Then the reward is calculated with

``` python 
top = np.maximum(1, sum(reward**2) - sum(reward)**2 / n)
bottom = (n - 1) * n
prec = np.sqrt(top / bottom)
```

For complete details, look in `summary-stats-v2.py`.


TODO: modify the script that generates the Excel file to remove `stats/`.
