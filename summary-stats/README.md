We publish summary stats for each contest. These summary stats include every
caption and how often it was rated funny/unfunny/somewhat funny.

i.e., we use the below file for each algorithm with the experiment.

```csv
Unfunny,Somewhat funny,Funny,Caption
49,20,1,Hey look, a wild caption!
0,0,100,The perfect caption
...
```

These files are generated by `summary-stats.py` from
`participant-responses.csv` in each experiment. We then generate an Excel file
from these sheets.

TODO: modify the script that generates the Excel file to remove `stats/`.
