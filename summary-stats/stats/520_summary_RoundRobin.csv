0,0,0,The guilt is one thing, but the lawsuits are insurmountable.
0,0,0,By now, don't you think the fruit-vs-vegetable conflict is perhaps a moot point?
0,0,0,When did you last feel like hurting someone?
0,0,0,And how does that make you feel when someone steps on you?
0,0,0,Something must be missing inside of me because I always make women fall hard for me but I don't fall for them.
0,0,0,And how long do you feel better after making the clown slip?
0,0,0,...and why do you think people are laughing at you?
0,0,0,So, tell me about these slip ups that you've made.
0,0,0,Premature evacuation happens to everyone.
0,0,0,I believe you have a split personality.
0,0,0,Freudian slip duly noted.
0,0,0,...So you say you're always being stepped on?
0,0,0,Why do you have a fear of monkeys?
0,0,0,Why do you believe that I am the one who should be psychoanalyzed?
0,0,0,That all depends on how you define the word 'split'.
0,0,0,Now, about those slip-ups...
0,0,0,The dysfunction's treatable, no problem. Can't help you with the empty feeling, though.
0,0,0,So should we talk about how horrible chimpanzees are?
0,0,0,That empty feeling could take you down a slippery slope...
0,0,0,"You're right...you do not have any six a-peel".
0,0,0,This is why I don't schedule appointments on my lunch break.
0,0,0,I'm afraid I'm going to need to terminate our therapeutic relationship; you're simply too a-peeling for me to maintain professional boundaries.
0,0,0,You have to stop blaming yourself.
0,0,0,I'm referring you out. I don't treat fruits.
0,0,0,So why do you think Jane Goodall ruined your family life?
0,0,0,Ah yes: that empty feeling, that empty feeling....
0,0,0,So you feel like the scapegoat?
0,0,0,Why do you prefer to identify as a plantain?
0,0,0,I know you're depressed since you're no longer not top banana, but I think you still have appeal.
0,0,0,I find that patients who don't make a Freudian slip feel they're not getting their money's worth.
0,0,0,So, you've gone back to your cage before my first question?
0,0,0,"And to think, after all of these years, it was me who was slipping".
0,0,0,So there was no money in the banana stand for you? Only terror?
0,0,0,And how did that make you feel -- the no-slip sole?
0,0,0,It was a slip of the tongue. A Freudian slip. Continue.
0,0,0,You know we discussed this before. The operation was not going to solve all your problems.
0,0,0,And when did you begin feeling this sense of, well, emptiness?
0,0,0,So, he slipped. We all slip.
0,0,0,And how did that make you feel when the banana deserted you for three scoops of ice cream and a maraschino cherry?
0,0,0,What do you think caused you to slip?
0,0,0,And did you feel this way before you were peeled?
0,0,0,You're a textbook disabler.
0,0,0,You know, if you keep letting your husband walk all over you, he'll...hear a slide whistle, probably.
0,0,0,What makes you think people are stepping all over you?
0,0,0,If you say 'Freudian slip' one more time I'm ending our session early.
0,0,0,Well doc, I just keep having these nightmares of people slipping one after another after another. You think it has something to do with me?
0,0,0,So it seems like everyone is blaming you for their downfall?
0,0,0,Over and over I hear 'slip and fall' in my head.
0,0,0,Good work! You've discovered your inner self.
0,0,0,Viagra might help me stay up longer.
0,0,0,Yes, a midlife career change can be stressful.
0,0,0,I swear that watermelon ain't no kin of mine. We don't even look alike.
0,0,0,Yes, I can see how it would be very painful that you never got any of the acclaim that all your comedy partners enjoyed.
0,0,0,Impersonating a starfish. Okay, other options for your next career?
0,0,0,If you want to be known for your wit, you have to stay off the sidewalks.
0,0,0,Nobody believes or trusts me when I say: "I'll always stick by you."
0,0,0,Would you say it was an amicable split?
0,0,0,You shouldn't feel guilty every time someone falls. Just the funny times.
0,0,0,Your ex married a plantain. How does that make you feel?
0,0,0,Don't focus on the "only"--beauty IS skin deep.
0,0,0,So, Mr. Fofanna, what brings you in today?
0,0,0,How do you feel about people falling all over you?
0,0,0,Do you want to be addressed as 'he,' 'she,' or..?
0,0,0,Tell me more about this feeling that your life is just a series of jokes.
0,0,0,Not longer being ripe doesn't mean you're rotten.
0,0,0,I know you feel empty inside, but don't you think it's wrong to blame all gorillas?
0,0,0,We all sometimes feel like second banana.
0,0,0,So you say you're not peeling very well.
0,0,0,so why do you think the others in the bunch don't appreciate your sense of humor?
0,0,0,My family is splitting apart!
0,0,0,Why do you believe you're a vaudevillian at heart?
0,0,0,Over a barrel or out on a limb--which one takes more pluck?
0,0,0,I feel like I'm slipping out of line
0,0,0,I have a green office, not a green thumb.
0,0,0,i have the feeling that my attraction for feet is slipping away
0,0,0,I don't make people laugh anymore.
0,0,0,Let me get this straight: you’re tired of being appealing?
0,0,0,You slip on me, baby, and I'll be sure to catch you.
0,0,0,So she'll never dance again ... how do you feel about that?
0,0,0,For once, I'd like some to be glad to say "banana."
0,0,0,what is below the skin here?
0,0,0,Let's talk about your self-esteem. Do you think that others find you a'peeling?
0,0,0,In our last session, Mr. Banana, you were confused as to whether you were appealing, or just a peeling. It looks like you resolved that issue.
0,0,0,Sometimes I think I'd be better off bread.
0,0,0,Uh huh..., and how that make you peel?
0,0,0,And how long have been hearing these screaming voices above you?
0,0,0,Trust in your brown spots. You're ready.
0,0,0,Slipping on your peel needs to be resolved.
0,0,0,Tell me about the time your parents split.
0,0,0,When did you first notice you were slipping back?
0,0,0,He blames you?
0,0,0,Psych hold? Worried I'd make others slip?
0,0,0,I'm so tired of being blamed for everybody's slip-ups!
0,0,0,Bi-polar? Banana split? Same difference.
0,0,0,Take your time. I'm comfortable with silence.
0,0,0,I recognize that others have fallen for you, but trust me, it's just transference.
0,0,0,I feel like I have been on a slippery slope as of late
0,0,0,Chiquita, it's not your fault. But it is your problem.
0,0,0,I think next week should begin peeling away the source of your transference.
0,0,0,It all started when a bunch of us got together for a friendly breakfast...
0,0,0,What I hear you saying is that you feel unappealing!
0,0,0,Three days on the street and not one person slipped!
0,0,0,You say your parents were eaten by chimpanzees?
0,0,0,Sounds to me like a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Does he remind you of anyone, this big gorilla you say you see outside the window right now?
0,0,0,So, it feels like your life seems slippery at times?
0,0,0,Exercise might help
0,0,0,Sure the jokes are hurtful but you need to develop a thicker skin.
0,0,0,What do you mean "you slipped up"?
0,0,0,You're thinking only skin-deep--get to the substance!
0,0,0,Well, yes that is quite a breakthrough.
0,0,0,I just wanted to let you know you are HOT!
0,0,0,I think I could use a glass of water.
0,0,0,Yes, it is what's on the inside that counts.
0,0,0,Let's explore the difference between a phallic symbol and a sex symbol.
0,0,0,'I'd say your peelings of emptiness are very organic'
0,0,0,So how did it make you feel when your owner ate you?
0,0,0,What do you mean my slip is showing?
0,0,0,I'm sorry, Hillary, but hiding behind the old 'I slipped on a slip on a banana peel' made you do it excuse won't work here.
0,0,0,So she just slipped on you?
0,0,0,Which hurts more: When people walk all over you? Or the laughter?
0,0,0,When did these dreams of being smoked first begin?
0,0,0,So you tripped him. Then what?
0,0,0,Don't internalize blame -- it is his own fault he slipped on you.
0,0,0,How did you feel when she fell for you?
0,0,0,It is my fault she slipped out of my life.
0,0,0,Tell me more about your peelings.
0,0,0,It's obvious to me that you can no longer afford to ignore the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room!
0,0,0,I don't find your thoughts about me at all appealing!
0,0,0,Yes, I do understand emptiness.
0,0,0,My wife says I'm no longer her top banana.
0,0,0,Why do you feel like a cliche?
0,0,0,We knew that when you began the gender reassignment it was going to be s slippery slope!
0,0,0,Perhaps you misunderstood when she said she was going to slip on something a little nicer.
0,0,0,No, Mr. Bananafuco, Viagra won't help. It's a clear case of banana ennui.
0,0,0,Look at it this way. You're also a great source of humor.
0,0,0,You are not going to make any progress if you keep worrying about how people pronounce your name.
0,0,0,So when people step all over you, you lash out and make them fall?
0,0,0,I think you misunderstand what a Freudian slip is.
0,0,0,Why do you think you lack appeal?
0,0,0,You grew up in a poor country, came here against your will in a cardboard box, and are routinely criticized for not being as good as your peers. Of course you'd want revenge.
0,0,0,Well, I guess that could be a valid argument for abstinence only sex education....
0,0,0,Go on, Mr. Bobbitt.
0,0,0,Split. Your time is up.
0,0,0,It sounds like you mistook what she meant by "split."
0,0,0,Peelings? I thought you were here to work on your feelings!
0,0,0,And what makes you think people have been avoiding you?
0,0,0,And how do you feel when she says you are not apeeling?
0,0,0,The term is parentified child, Karl.
0,0,0,How long have you had the feeling of being just an old joke?
0,0,0,Sometimes, I just feel so empty.
0,0,0,I don't think Dr. Freud was thinking of you when he was talking about Freudian slips!
0,0,0,You're more than a cheap laugh. You're a slightly below average protective shell
0,0,0,For how long have you felt that something is missing?
0,0,0,That is a slimy thought.
0,0,0,Give it to me straight doc, do you think I'm bananas?
0,0,0,"How long do you feel you've been slipping?
0,0,0,What you're describing is separation anxiety and, given your time together, that's perfectly normal.
0,0,0,Interesting... this friend... A lawyer... You think he's just using you...
0,0,0,I had a dream last night that I slipped on Freud.
0,0,0,So, was it a recent split?
0,0,0,Doctor, I need help. I split on my wife.
0,0,0,What's the difference that you ended up in a banana cream pie rather than a banana split? They're both to die for.
0,0,0,How do you feel about your inner child ending up in a smoothie?
0,0,0,I feel rotten lately.
0,0,0,...it's normal to feel discarded after the relationship ends.
0,0,0,So, how do you "pheel" about the fact that she dumped you so easily after taking care of her all this time?
0,0,0,You expect me to fall for that line?
0,0,0,Okay, Chiquita, what did you do to make them put you in the refrigerator?
0,0,0,You shouldn't feel guilty. Jason brought the banana peel challenge upon himself.
0,0,0,Please don't refer to your loss as, "he left you".
0,0,0,I have this recurring, uneasy dream that I've turned into a giant insect.
0,0,0,You feel empty inside and think that is slippery ground to be on?
0,0,0,I hear that you are learning to open properly.
0,0,0,It's been almost two months since my last slip, but I am feeling optimistic about this week.
0,0,0,What you're experiencing is called compost-traumatic stress disorder.
0,0,0,So explain to me again why it's NOT what's on the inside that matters...
0,0,0,I give up. How DID the banana cause a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,So in your dream, my little Chiquita, the pedestrian steps on you and falls backward into a vat of ice cream. You shout "Cherry." This, I'm afraid, is a classic case of Banana Split Personality.
0,0,0,Tell me about your relationship with Chiquita.
0,0,0,To keep things in perspective, it's important to remember that it's not just your ego that was bruised...
0,0,0,How often do you have the Carmen Miranda dream?
0,0,0,Why is it you feel everyone around you keeps getting hurt?
0,0,0,I know people are saying you're bananas but my diagnosis is split personality
0,0,0,I told you I don't go out with my patients, not even for "just a cup of coffee." It's a slippery slope.
0,0,0,That's very interesting, Mr. Peel. I am interested in whether you think that there was something you did to make your banana split?
0,0,0,. . . and you said you went . . . what?
0,0,0,Well, The Banana Republic isn’t exactly welcoming if you’re a foreigner.
0,0,0,I see an underlying cause for your performance anxiety.
0,0,0,Just keep telling yourself "It's not my fault. It's not my fault".
0,0,0,And you were still living as a male then?
0,0,0,So, yes, you have no banana. But how does that make you feel?
0,0,0,How long have you obsessed about being a Chiquita fruit bowl?
0,0,0,Well, this is some troubling symbolism.
0,0,0,Nobody takes me seriously.
0,0,0,I've got a thick skin but nothing left inside. That is the price of leadership!
0,0,0,That's all very nice, but where do you keep your wallet?
0,0,0,How long have you been a stalker?
0,0,0,So, let's explore why you enjoy watching people slip.
0,0,0,It's not so much that I feel empty inside, it's that I feel used.
0,0,0,So you just let people step all over you?
0,0,0,Look: we all get stepped on. Deal with it.
0,0,0,When did you first get this feeling of emptiness?
0,0,0,'So how long have you felt like you should have been born a plantain?'
0,0,0,So your're angry about slipping on an Orange peel and can't let it go.
0,0,0,Being a Foster child didn't work out so well for me...
0,0,0,No, no. I don't think you're nuts at all...
0,0,0,It could very well be that people keep giving you the slip because you're just too appealing!
0,0,0,I live in fear that someone will slip on me.
0,0,0,I'll take you seriously when you start taking yourself seriously.
0,0,0,Have you attempted suicide before?
0,0,0,And you said you feel that people don't find you appealing?
0,0,0,I can't listen to any more. Daylight come and me wanna go home.
0,0,0,How long has your life seemed fruitless?
0,0,0,This business of you just lying on the floor is very passive aggressive.
0,0,0,This reminds me, I have to pick up my groceries.
0,0,0,Freudian slip? You're talkin' to the real thing, baby.
0,0,0,You need to get over your guilt about making the founder of our profession fall.
0,0,0,When did you first realize that you were born to be a mango ?
0,0,0,I'm glad you finally opened up.
0,0,0,The alternative was Uber...
0,0,0,Oops! I just made a Freudian slip!
0,0,0,Damn . . . I can hardly resist your appeal !
0,0,0,Let's work on picking yourself up.
0,0,0,Being "organic" is causing problems at work?
0,0,0,Why do you say you´ve lost your inner self?
0,0,0,How long have you felt you are a jinx?
0,0,0,Let's try and peel back some more layers
0,0,0,Tell him he can't eat the fruit, then just throw away the peel.
0,0,0,Aren't you going to do a split, too? Oh. This isn't yoga?
0,0,0,So let me understand... You're feeling guilt about surviving the New York City marathon after saw so many of your comrades were stepped on. Tell me more about that.
0,0,0,It's not you fault. They should look where they're stepping.
0,0,0,Court appointed psych evaluation for a slip and fall offender
0,0,0,Let's call them experiences rather than slip-ups.
0,0,0,Everyone slips up sometimes.
0,0,0,Would you consider yourself passive aggressive?
0,0,0,I don't think that's very funny.
0,0,0,But you didn't actually cause a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,So how long have you had these feelings of being totally discarded?
0,0,0,And she said i was to blame for her freudian slips!
0,0,0,So the melody didn't bother you as much as the lyrics to 'Yes, we have no bananas?'
0,0,0,Do you think you'd be less depressed if you could learn to enjoy physical comedy?
0,0,0,I've always been unamused at clowns slipping on me.
0,0,0,Tell me about the split, again.
0,0,0,Even if you are appealing, you can't expect everyone you meet to fall head over heels.
0,0,0,You're slipping again.
0,0,0,Can you tell me your story again? This time with no slip-ups
0,0,0,Quit blaming yourself for other people's slip-ups.
0,0,0,We don't want you slipping back into bad behavior
0,0,0,So you say she slipped on you and it's been downhill ever since.
0,0,0,Do you have any idea what it's like listening to your friends go on and on every day about how juicy they are? I can't take it anymore. And the orange. He's the WORST!
0,0,0,You feel '"blamed."
0,0,0,"So you feel your life is slipping away"!
0,0,0,So tell me more about Daiquiri.
0,0,0,So you say your turning into a banana, we start by pulling yourself together
0,0,0,St tell me why you think your legs suck.
0,0,0,So whose always ridiculing your potassium deficiency?
0,0,0,Why do you think he fell for you?
0,0,0,How have you been peeling lately?
0,0,0,"I know I keep slipping up and bringing people down with me".
0,0,0,Your ego is so easily bruised. You need to develop a thicker skin.
0,0,0,I believe you're suffering from separation anxiety.
0,0,0,How do you feel when people insist that, biologically, you're a berry?
0,0,0,Why am I the only fruit which grows vertically in lieu of hanging dowm?
0,0,0,I feel like my life has become one big joke.
0,0,0,I feel like my life is just some big joke.
0,0,0,I don't mean to be insensitive, but I never get AGE SPOTS!
0,0,0,We started dating after he represented me in a slip and fall case . . .
0,0,0,The narcissistic banana had a selfie addiction and no longer found himself apeeling.
0,0,0,You're not alone, Mr. Thompson -- people tell ME that I'm not a real therapist.
0,0,0,And sometimes a banana peel is just a banana peel.
0,0,0,I can't get past losing my appeal!
0,0,0,Regrets? Oh, boy, you betcha. Like being pollinated, for starters.
0,0,0,Yes, I believe you are having some type of separation anxiety, but let's dig deeper.
0,0,0,I can see why you think going on is fruitless Mr. Dole.
0,0,0,When did you start slipping up?
0,0,0,So at this stage you feel there is nothing good inside of you/
0,0,0,Most don't want people walking all over them.
0,0,0,For starters, shame is quite different from guilt.
0,0,0,So your angst is about sharing appeal with Donald Trump?
0,0,0,Okay... you met the gorilla your dreams... and then what?
0,0,0,I had it again! That same dream of being eaten alive next to three giant scoops of ice cream.
0,0,0,Don't underestimate your sex appeal.
0,0,0,I suggest that you wear an outfit less provocative to work...
0,0,0,Let's peel that back
0,0,0,This recent split really took a toll on me
0,0,0,Let's talk about a time when you fell down.
0,0,0,Lately, I've been feeling more like just shell and no content.
0,0,0,As I see it, your worries about losing your position in the comedy business are just part of your overall fear of failure. Maybe all you need is to get a better straight-man.
0,0,0,Let's get in touch with your inner self.
0,0,0,We've all slipped up, the key is to stop enabling others to slip up as well.
0,0,0,Have you always felt like a second?
0,0,0,"Peeling away the layers is difficult for me".
0,0,0,So why do you think there is something missing in your sex life?
0,0,0,At what point did you realize you were going bananas?
0,0,0,You are feeling empty. Have you eaten?
0,0,0,I have deep concerns about the degree of slippage you seem to create.
0,0,0,So how long have you had this fear of being stepped on?
0,0,0,Okay, I understand. You were the top banana. And then what happened?
0,0,0,Freudian slips I can analyze, I refer banana slips to Dr. B. Keaton.
0,0,0,A split personality is not out of the question.
0,0,0,YOU HAVE TO GET OVER THIS IDEA THAT YOUR SLIPPING.
0,0,0,That's not very appealing
0,0,0,I'm sure everyone's life feels like a bad joke at some point.
0,0,0,I feel so empty, slippery and empty.
0,0,0,I feel empty and unfulfilled.
0,0,0,That monkey used you, he didn't really love you for who you are.
0,0,0,Appeal is not my issue, ma'am.
0,0,0,I understand you feel like you are a peeling.
0,0,0,There you go, peel back all your masks.
0,0,0,In my diagnosis, I'd say you have 'split personality disorder.'
0,0,0,Let's talk about your fear of falling.
0,0,0,Everyone can't be the cherry on top of the sundae.
0,0,0,So, you feel your career has been limited to slapstick comedy?
0,0,0,Stop pouting, Cheeta, and come back to the couch. We have ten minutes left.
0,0,0,So you feel people are avoiding you?
0,0,0,So you're saying due to the popularity if plantains, you ego is now bruised?
0,0,0,I have this recurring nightmare, Doc...I'm on a sidewalk and NO ONE slips!
0,0,0,Yes, I would say it should be quite normal to feel a little empty inside
0,0,0,You're just spoiled.
0,0,0,Hmmm. You're venturing on to some very slippery terrain there.
0,0,0,He's such a showoff
0,0,0,What you are saying is that after being a comedy movie prop for so long, you think that you would like to direct.
0,0,0,So, why do you feel 'used'?
0,0,0,Damn Banana, were you made by Sam the banana man.
0,0,0,We need to start by peeling back the layers in order to uncover the problem
0,0,0,When did you first feel you sanity slipping.
0,0,0,I feel so discarded.
0,0,0,It's not a metaphor! She literally took my manhood and turned it into a smoothie!
0,0,0,I hear you saying you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,Yes, but everyone slips up at some point."
0,0,0,In my professional opinion, you ARE enabling slapstick.
0,0,0,I am sick of slapstick comedy I want to do something more dramatic!
0,0,0,Very gratifying. Onions can take years of work before they will peel the layers.
0,0,0,I'am sure women think your apealing
0,0,0,I see them all—starlets, star makers, and now...starfish.
0,0,0,So you've lost touch with your inner self-tell me about that.
0,0,0,Are you saying your father is Harry Bellafonte and your grandmother is Gypsy Rose Lee?
0,0,0,I think we all struggle with feeling of emptiness on some level.
0,0,0,You say this chimpanzee pinched you hard on the nose, and then devoured your guts?
0,0,0,Do you want to talk about how you felt when Freud slipped on you?
0,0,0,Of course you don't like being stepped on. You're a banana peel.
0,0,0," I have a very slippery personality".
0,0,0,OK, I think we're getting into a slippery area now.
0,0,0,I know I'm better than that couch potato
0,0,0,My future feels like a slippery slope
0,0,0,I think you can stop second-guessing your own premise. If you think they set you up to be the fall guy, then they probably did.
0,0,0,No one takes me seriously either!
0,0,0,It's natural to feel discarded from time to time...
0,0,0,Tell me more about this dream with your father and the blender
0,0,0,When he used your insides for a smoothie, how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,Well, that was highly unethical, but I needed that. I do often get hangry during these sessions.
0,0,0,Lately I just feel all empty inside.
0,0,0,So why is it so important to be the top banana?
0,0,0,It appears that you have a banana-split personality
0,0,0,And how many people have slipped on you?

0,0,0,I think we're getting into slippery territory here...
0,0,0,So,tell me again about growing up in the Republic.
0,0,0,So you tell me how you peel?
0,0,0,I've always felt like a cabaret accoutrement.
0,0,0,So you're saying, despite its appeal, infidelity is a slippery slope. . .
0,0,0,What makes you think people need you to slip up?
0,0,0,Why do you think people don't find you appealing ?
0,0,0,I'm sure people are laughing WITH you, not AT you.
0,0,0,Mrs. Banana didn't find me apeeling. We split.
0,0,0,I used to be a terrifying octopus - now look at me!
0,0,0,Now that we've succussfully peeled back the layers, you need to begin work on acknowledging you're a fruit.

0,0,0,No. I would not like to slip away with you.
0,0,0,So, you feel that others around you are slipping, but not you?
0,0,0,Okay, so you feel discarded and tired of being stepped on, but feel guilty for hurting people....is that right?
0,0,0,So your wife split?
0,0,0,I couldn't help myself. I just finished working out and I was feeling hypoglycemic.
0,0,0,My dissertation was on Freudian slips.
0,0,0,You are not some placeholder for some inner banana’s feelings.
0,0,0,What do you mean 'banana envy' doctor?
0,0,0,You called it off just because he called you a bahnana instead of a banana?
0,0,0,You're looking a bit peel, is there something more I should know?
0,0,0,It sounds like the anxiety issues actually started before you were separated from the bunch.
0,0,0,What do mean when you say you sometimes go bananas?
0,0,0,Tell me about the clowns again.
0,0,0,As your therapist, I have to tell you that you're not a-peeling.

0,0,0,When we peel back the layers you'll realize you're not to blame for others fallings.
0,0,0,You seem to me to have somewhat of a split personality.
0,0,0,...go on, why does it appeal to you?
0,0,0,I've felt rotten since the split.
0,0,0,I'm sure strawberries have it just as bad.

0,0,0,I have this empty feeling inside.
0,0,0,'Now tell me, what happened after the chimp first spotted you'
0,0,0,I'm glad you're here, Alan. This is the first step to uncovering your fear of getting walked on.
0,0,0,What makes you think I'm interested in phallic symbols?

0,0,0,It's quite normal to feel empty after a split.
0,0,0,Kiss me and I'll turn into a handsome Prince
0,0,0,I guess you are not happy to see me.
0,0,0,That's not what I meant when I said be the change you want to see.
0,0,0,But what's really missing on the inside?
0,0,0,I know you feel empty inside, but try and stay positive – someone could slip on you and that would be hilarious.
0,0,0,What did you expect? You fell in love with a monkey!
0,0,0,So she slipped. Get over it!
0,0,0,I can assure you you're not the cause of any Freudian Slip
0,0,0,I don't think they're laughing AT you, they're laughing BECAUSE of you
0,0,0,Fruitless? Yellow? Slippery? Can you be more specific?
0,0,0,Being chosen last in the fruit bowl won't necessarily happen again if you try out for the stick ball team.
0,0,0,Let's get back to your dream of making my husband slip and break his pelvis
0,0,0,Maybe it's time to face the fact that comedy has moved on without you.
0,0,0,Were they laughing at you, or the man who slipped on you?
0,0,0,You really are a naughty banana.
0,0,0,I see you're still grappling with the recent split.
0,0,0,I was mishandled and bruised...as many of us were
0,0,0,She tore out my insides.
0,0,0,You should have seen me, I was a star in the silent film days, but now nobody wants me.
0,0,0,Do I find you attractive? Why, you are appeal itself!
0,0,0,I only get laughs when people step on me.
0,0,0,everything has problems
0,0,0,a banana a day keeps the patient away,,,
0,0,0,You know sometimes a banana is only a banana.
0,0,0,I recommend getting in touch with your inner plantain.
0,0,0,So what you seem to be saying is you have never been the same since your parents split.
0,0,0,My banana left me because he said he had appeal without me.
0,0,0,Looks like someone made my job easier.
0,0,0,When did you first suspect that she only loved you for your potassium?
0,0,0,When I said I found you appealing, it was just a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I never thought we would split.
0,0,0,Sometimes we have to peel away the layers to get at what is really bothering us.
0,0,0,Don't give me that Freudian slip routine!
0,0,0,I keep dreaming that I'm in a jungle being chased by apes and I can't escape.
0,0,0,Well, with it completely gone I suggest you simply increase the foreplay.
0,0,0,Have you lost a connection to the inner you?
0,0,0,Still, a part of you will always be in her fruit salad.
0,0,0,What's eating you?
0,0,0,I told you I was going bananas.
0,0,0,So how did you feel when the banana split?
0,0,0,O.K., let's recap: you've lost a lot of weight; you're lost you sex appeal; you don't feel whole any more, you miss your bunch of buddies and you sense that you are slipping. Time to recycle your life.
0,0,0,That's what happens when you let people walk on you.
0,0,0,I watched my parents brown right in front of me
0,0,0,You gave Freud the slip, when exactly?
0,0,0,It seems to me like you may be struggling with an eaten disorder
0,0,0,You say your wife split and your life is slipping away?
0,0,0,So, you thought that the ice cream shop wanted you as an employee?
0,0,0,So tell me again, you slipped on what?
0,0,0,You keep looking at my feet.
0,0,0,Yes, I can see how that was very emasculating.
0,0,0,You need to find your inner piece.
0,0,0,My wife is always telling me I'm nothing but a synecdoche.
0,0,0,You're suffering from a common case of plantain envy.
0,0,0,When did you realize you were not organic?
0,0,0,I'm in a love triangle with vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.
0,0,0,I am not appealing. You are!
0,0,0,So you find life to be slipping away from you?
0,0,0,No, it is not because you are seen as just an empty suit.
0,0,0,And when did you start identifying as a plantain?
0,0,0,You aren't responsible for other people's accidents.
0,0,0,My initial diagnosis is separation anxiety.
0,0,0,At least you're not another fruitcake.
0,0,0,And how did that make you peel?
0,0,0,You're heading down a slippery slope. Don't trip on yourself.
0,0,0,I seem to have lost my purpose in life.
0,0,0,It's clear we need to achieve some closure.
0,0,0,How did it make you feel when he peeled you?
0,0,0,What is happening when you get this feeling that everyone is laughing at you?
0,0,0,Yes, but why do you worry you won't be taken seriously?
0,0,0,So...You slipped again?
0,0,0,Perhaps you're hanging around with the wrong bunch.
0,0,0,You think you are what made Fueud slip.
0,0,0,Do you feel like people are walking all over you?
0,0,0,And how long have you been having this recurring nightmare of the clumsy man in a porkpie hat?
0,0,0,I no longer feel appealing
0,0,0,He dumped me to get another banana.
0,0,0,Help me, Doctor! I just hate making people slip and fall but I always have such a strong inner compulsion to do it!
0,0,0,It must have been hard to feel like you were destined to be compost.
0,0,0,For next week's session, let's work on being a cantelope
0,0,0,You need to understand the difference between making a 'Freudian Slip' and making a Freud slip.
0,0,0,So your mother was really a plantain......
0,0,0,You're in a pickle?
0,0,0,I have this reoccurring dream where I slip on a human being.
0,0,0,You're ahh peeling... I mean appealing.
0,0,0,I'm afraid you're suffering from a split personality.
0,0,0,So you think that you're responsible for the Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Mine is an inclusive practice--all gender identities, fauna, and flora.
0,0,0,Do not let one slip up define who you are.
0,0,0,Have you always had a fear of sidewalks?
0,0,0,Tell me more about your father. You said he was always just hanging around?
0,0,0,Let's explore why you feel all eaten up inside.
0,0,0,It's not what is your problem, but what are you?
0,0,0,Quick, Henry, the banana spray!
0,0,0,Maybe you should try being the victim for once, and see how that feels.
0,0,0,(When your married to David Copper field.) "Honey, can you hurry up and say "Abra-ca-dabra" because your body is sweating fruit juice on my sofa."
0,0,0,Well that's an unappealing position to take.
0,0,0,Nobody slips on me anymore
0,0,0,So, why did your parents want you to go in a different direction?
0,0,0,Of course you feel stepped on.
0,0,0,On Skype, someone will know you are a peel
0,0,0,Was it a slip, or a fall?
0,0,0,Ever since she left, it's like my life has been rotting away.
0,0,0,She's not the only one 'fleck'd with brown and a golden hue.'
0,0,0,I don't know why, but I am just feeling so empty on the inside.
0,0,0,"Tell me again about the "... are you just happy to see me?" joke.
0,0,0,I'm too lazy to pick up after my husband. He can pick up after himself.
0,0,0,I can understand why you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,So let me get this straight... you say that people falling head over heels for you is a bad thing? f?
0,0,0,I thought we worked through your wish that I slip on you.
0,0,0,How can I step up when everybody's always stepping on me?
0,0,0,We call that a "Freudian Slip."
0,0,0,A slip is usually the result - not cause - of an unconscious mind.
0,0,0,So you feel an emptiness inside?
0,0,0,Would you describe your relationship with your father as slippery?
0,0,0,And in this dream, what is in your pocket?
0,0,0,Tell me about your separation from the bunch.
0,0,0,What about the bee in your dream that keeps getting closer and closer?
0,0,0,Textbook garden variety slip, not a Freudian one.
0,0,0,So you caused a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Do you have insurance?
0,0,0,Have you tried less ethylene?
0,0,0,What do you do for fun?
0,0,0,You're a top banana that feels empty inside.
0,0,0,I think we can rule out low potassium as the cause of your depression.
0,0,0,Today let's discuss why you feel so unappealing.
0,0,0,I didn't think you would take "penis envy" personally.
0,0,0,Barry the Banana thought he was opening up to her, but his therapist decided he should split.
0,0,0,So, tell me exactly when your banana split.
0,0,0,I know I should have considered the consequences, but it was so funny in the cartoons
0,0,0,We call those Freudian slips.
0,0,0,Are you sure it was a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,So, you feel like a phony because you lack substance, but you still have appeal?
0,0,0,So you feel that bad luck follows you? Let's explore...
0,0,0,Let's peel back another layer and really dig into the meat of your issues.
0,0,0,Tell me why you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,So you say you feel empty inside for some reason
0,0,0,So how did you feel after you split?
0,0,0,I'm afraid you have split personality disorder.
0,0,0,Girls fall for me, Doc. I'm tellin' ya. One slip and they fall for me.
0,0,0,What makes you think people are always falling for you?
0,0,0,You got hungry!?
0,0,0,It feels like I am the one who is always containing the relationship.
0,0,0,What's the deal banana peel?
0,0,0,I know, but eventually we're all compost.
0,0,0,So you were never the same after the split?
0,0,0,Well, Freud said that we are perfect, but we are missing our spears.
0,0,0,I like to eat,eat, eat, apples and banninees
0,0,0,Now I understand why dreams of oral sex were so terrifying for you.
0,0,0,Try to look past the pain of being peeled to see that it opens an exciting new chapter in your life.
0,0,0,Isn't it time to let go of your guilt
0,0,0,So you feel he treats you like trash?
0,0,0,Put yourself first; let everything else fall as it may.
0,0,0,I'm Chaquita Banana, and I was very sexy until I offered my delicious taste and nutrition to everyone.
0,0,0,It's not all about you. Some are just Freudian.
0,0,0,after all that, she stole my idea for the slip n' slide
0,0,0,What makes you think they are laughing at you and not with you?
0,0,0,Feelings of inadequacy? Yes, and I just don't think I have appeal
0,0,0,Repeat the part about it striking midnight and then...
0,0,0,You seem less phallic obsessive this week.
0,0,0,So you used to be top-banana on Broadway, but aging made you lose your appeal?
0,0,0,You want Freud to slip. How about this, " Sometimes a banana is just a banana".
0,0,0,I had foster parents.
0,0,0,It takes a lot of courage to bare yourself like this. I respect that.
0,0,0,How did you feel when your parents split?
0,0,0,And then, she just split.
0,0,0,I'm sorry, I suppose food chain is an inappropriate analogy, but you didn't like slippery slope either.
0,0,0,So... you feel like you're constantly seen as some kind of joke?
0,0,0,You need to free yourself of the guilt, he did not slip because of you
0,0,0,Let's talk about why you call your ex-husband a big ape.
0,0,0,I'll see you at group next week with a bunch
0,0,0,I'm a chili pepper and I'm hot for you.
0,0,0,What makes you think you've lost your appeal?
0,0,0,I'm sure someone out there will find you aPEELing...
0,0,0,Tell me, how did you feel when to be slipped over? And the previous time?
0,0,0,"Mr. Peel you suffer from classic abandonment issue's".
0,0,0,Stop staring at my shoes that way.
0,0,0,And when he said that, how did that make you peel?
0,0,0,You're not the first banana I've had that feels on the inside they're really a plantain.
0,0,0,If only we could peel away some more of your past.
0,0,0,I thought I had tough skin, by I always feel empty inside.
0,0,0,"People stepping all over me is no joke".
0,0,0,My friends say that I am too slippery. But, I blame that on hereditary.
0,0,0,I'm headed for a split.
0,0,0,Yours is the worst case of separation anxiety I've ever seen.
0,0,0,I believe that you believe you're a banana peel.
0,0,0,Don't define yourself as accident prone; they don't have to step on you.
0,0,0,How long have you peeled this way?
0,0,0,So you hear dime a day Willie Loman saying, "You can't eat the fruit and throw away the peel" - in no way does that total loser invalidate your worthiness as a banana peel.
0,0,0,Yes, other fruit. ANY other fruit. Do you think I'm crazy?
0,0,0,The time has come to heel.
0,0,0,Last week you're Marshian green and this week you're Asian yellow. I'm diagnosing you with a split personality.
0,0,0,She said I have no guts and now I feel empty inside. You know what I mean?
0,0,0,All things considered, I'd say thinking about bananas all the time is not a sexual thing in your case.
0,0,0,Come out from under the coffee table and confront your feelings, Kong.
0,0,0,How long have you felt everything around you was slipping ?
0,0,0,I think this is a classic case of splitting.
0,0,0,Let's go back to the time when your parents put you in the refrigerator.
0,0,0,What do you suppose is the cause of your guilt feelings?
0,0,0,Are you still feeling empty inside?
0,0,0,Professionally speaking, you are one banana short of a full load.
0,0,0,Tell me about the first time you made a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Let's talk about why you feel objectified by women.
0,0,0,I would not go down that slippery slope, if I were you!
0,0,0,Maybe if you were less slimy, people wouldn't step on you so much.
0,0,0,Why can't you just stop being a contract killer you're tired of wiping out people who slip up on you?
0,0,0,Your guilt about all the harm that you've caused in the past is preventing you from moving forward.
0,0,0,Excuse me, but it's MY job to peel back the layers
0,0,0,So how are you peeling today?
0,0,0,Now, on those occasions when you were being punished -- placed in the refrigerator--was the refrigerator light on, or were you in total darkness?
0,0,0,Sounds like separation anxiety. When did you first experience these feelings?
0,0,0,You need to feel more comfortable being the beginning of the slippery slope.
0,0,0,I'll split with you any day.
0,0,0,I didn't say your mind was THAT slippery!
0,0,0,You need to realize your own appeal and stop letting yourself always get stepped on in relationships.
0,0,0,So why do you feel empty on the inside?
0,0,0,Let me ask the questions. Do you think people find you appealing?
0,0,0,It might be something as simple as having 'Low T'...
0,0,0,Your failure to respond is not helpful.
0,0,0,You did what!!!
0,0,0,I feel like people are always stepping on me
0,0,0,I am NOT hiding it under my skirt.
0,0,0,I'm worried I'm going to start slipping again.
0,0,0,The fact that people keep blaming you for their slip-ups should not make you paranoid.
0,0,0,Forget me. Let's stay focused on you and how you jazz up your own damn corn flakes.
0,0,0,I don't know why I feel this way; I just feel all used up.
0,0,0,You say that you were abruptly separated from your siblings?
0,0,0,tell me more about this feeling of emptiness inside...
0,0,0,So you feel people are always slipping up?
0,0,0,And how does it make you feel when he blames you?
0,0,0,Doc, I have this fear of sidewalks
0,0,0,"Sorry" says the psychiatrist, "I can only help homo sapiens!
0,0,0,I think you took my suggestion to try to be more appealing a little too literally.
0,0,0,We split up on a Sundae
0,0,0,He just uses me for potassium.
0,0,0,So... you say you take pleasure in people stepping all over you, but you're not sure whether you're a masochist or a sadist?
0,0,0,Can you tell me why your not feeling comfortable in your own skin ?
0,0,0,Of course your best years are behind you. But, you can still make people laugh!
0,0,0,She used to put me in the refrigerator.
0,0,0,Every slip isn't necessarily Freudian.
0,0,0,But there can only be ONE top banana!
0,0,0,One at a time. Please.
0,0,0,Please help me Ms, it just made my skin crawl, when I realised I was let with the vegetables.
0,0,0,Your recurring dream about a cigar... How long have you been having it?
0,0,0,Yes, to say I feel like garbage is probably an understatement.
0,0,0,I'm not your sweet kumquat.
0,0,0,...I know, Rachael, but I assure you--you're genetically modified to NOT become your mother.
0,0,0,"It's not your fault people keep falling for you".
0,0,0,I bet he thinks he's worth two of us.
0,0,0,Identity dysphoria can make you think you're not a peeling.
0,0,0,No, I will not slip into something more comfortable.
0,0,0,How did you feel when you finally separated yourself from the bunch?
0,0,0,I don't think he meant disrespect by calling you 'chiquita.'
0,0,0,I feel like my life is slipping away.
0,0,0,Tell me how it feels to be skinned.
0,0,0,Actually I deal with quite a lot of banana splits
0,0,0,You're completely normal, I'm a little worried about myself though.
0,0,0,So tell me about the first time you started to peel?
0,0,0,What is your problem?" "My skin is peeling
0,0,0,Let's talk about all those years watching your mother sabotage your father.
0,0,0,Mr. Dole, I can help you peel away those concerns. Let's begin with your lack of taste. I hear that you develop this problem when you travel long distances?
0,0,0,Just tell me what's eating you
0,0,0,Tell me about the split.
0,0,0,I feel like I'm going down a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Abandonment issues are no excuse to look up women's skirts.
0,0,0,I aspired to be Bananas Foster but ended up in somebody's smoothie.
0,0,0,Studies indicate that an early traumatic peeling can cause low self esteem in later years.

0,0,0,Debbie's afternoon client used far fewer tissues than her morning client, the onion peel.
0,0,0,A study on self-treating bananaphobia
0,0,0,I've been feeling kinda empty.
0,0,0,I just have this fear that I'm going to cause her to slip, you know?
0,0,0,I'm guessing she slipped away as well.
0,0,0,And this feeling of emptiness?
0,0,0,No one will step on me . . .
0,0,0,Don't worry, I see lots of patients with split personalities.
0,0,0,And who do you feel second to?
0,0,0,'Paranoid? People take one look at me and begin to laugh.
0,0,0,So you're wearing everyone else's troubles?
0,0,0,My life is a joke.
0,0,0,He did that and then cast you aside?
0,0,0,She used me up, left me empty inside and just threw me away, Doc.
0,0,0,Please stay off my floor--no need to make a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I think you're just paranoid, everyone isn't trying to give you the slip.
0,0,0,She decided I no longer appealed to her so last Sunday she split and hooked up with a fast-talking plantain -- a real smoothie.
0,0,0,When did you start going bananas?
0,0,0,Well most of my patients ARE fruits!
0,0,0,And when did you first feel like you were going bananas?
0,0,0,Wow, this is the first time a patient has literally eaten their heart out!
0,0,0,You can't peel away your problems.
0,0,0,Tell me about life after the split.
0,0,0,So, why don't you think you have appeal?
0,0,0,I'm glad you find me appealing too...
0,0,0,Sorry. I know you have to peel away the outside to get at a problem but I was hungry.
0,0,0,My killer instinct just keeps growing.
0,0,0,They said I was ready. Now I feel as if someone stripped my dignity right out of me.
0,0,0,Feelings are like onions.
0,0,0,Broad, a peel.
0,0,0,Why do you think people can't see beyond your skin?
0,0,0,But you're not a cigar.
0,0,0,So, you think it was a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,So, you say you feel empty and fear you could be a danger to yourself or others...
0,0,0,So you feel that to be called "Chiquita" is sexist . . . ?
0,0,0,Is that a banana on your cushion or are you just happy to see me?
0,0,0,I'm afraid it may be too late for Viagra.
0,0,0,I feel so empty inside, so very unapeeling.
0,0,0,What you describe is a classic case of Oedipus complex, Cavendish
0,0,0,Actually that was just a regular slip.
0,0,0,My parents were both fostered.
0,0,0,Why do you think it makes you peel that way?
0,0,0,And how long have you been having these kinds of thoughts about sidewalks?
0,0,0,So what makes you think you're going bananas?
0,0,0,Yes, I think we'd all have to agree that your life has been one big stupid joke. So let's move on.
0,0,0,It is normal to feel empty inside after a banana split.
0,0,0,It is not your fault when someone slips.
0,0,0,So what's troubling you Mr. Banana? You seem so relaxed.
0,0,0,Ever since I opened up to you it has felt like something went missing.
0,0,0,No, your lack of tears doesn't surprise me. Most banana peels take two years to break down.
0,0,0,Yeah, sometimes life does feel like a slippery slope.
0,0,0,So what happens after you slip into this other realm?
0,0,0,I'm proud of you for sharing your peelings.
0,0,0,That was quite a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Honest, I'm not a slippery individual.
0,0,0,I realize we should maintain a professional, doctor and patient relationship, but be honest: Do I appeal to you?
0,0,0,What you've experienced is a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,So, at first, you found him appealing...?
0,0,0,A Freudian slipped?
0,0,0,I just don't get the appeal in hanging with the rest of the bunch.
0,0,0,You need to reconnect with your inner self.
0,0,0,I just feel like my split personality makes me less appealing
0,0,0,But you agreed to peal?
0,0,0,They think I don't have feelings.
0,0,0,I meant naked in the emotional sense but this works.
0,0,0,You may be irrational, but you're not bananas.
0,0,0,Tell me, why do you feel so unfulfilled?
0,0,0,You have a slippery appeal.
0,0,0,Cheer up! There's always slapstick.
0,0,0,Why comedies, comedies, comedies? Is it so wrong to think I can play Lear?
0,0,0,You can split, but you paid for the full hour.
0,0,0,So, did the Viagra help at all?
0,0,0,I think your having a small penis is the least of your worries Mr. Johnson.
0,0,0,While I'm certainly flattered, our canons of ethics prohibit any non-professional patient involvement.
0,0,0,So, you've been feeling funny.
0,0,0,Peeling, splitting and bruising? Your issues have ripened since I've last seen you, where should we start?
0,0,0,Sometimes a banana is just a damn fine dessert ingredient.
0,0,0,I didn't think the split would affect me this way.
0,0,0,That Ludwig keeps taunting: "Ba-Na-Na-Na!"
0,0,0,I sense a feeling of emptiness and a loss of bananahood
0,0,0,This seems to be less psychiatry and more internal medicine.
0,0,0,Doctor, you gotta help me. The comparisons to Trump's hair are really getting me down.
0,0,0,It’s not your fault you were the only survivor of the bunch.
0,0,0,So you feel your life’s now fruitless?
0,0,0,Your feel that your ability to "slip up" has caused you to loose your appeal?
0,0,0,Being unpeeled and discarded has caused me to become a serious risk to others.
0,0,0,This should be easy. You don't HAVE an inner self. (set in itals, not caps).
0,0,0,Honest, doc, it's gonna take a bunch to peal back what slipped me up years ago.
0,0,0,No, you're not that "slick." Now let's get back to our session.
0,0,0,What am I writing down? My grocery list.
0,0,0,Perhaps she only wanted you to think that her vulnerabilities were in the palm of your hand, Mr. Kong. Mr. Kong?
0,0,0,Really, size doesn't matter
0,0,0,I do think we've made progress since the split.
0,0,0,So, you split?
0,0,0,No, I don't think you're all peel and no banana.
0,0,0,...I feel like these days everyone is just waiting to give me the slip.
0,0,0,Let's not go there, it's a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Yes, I agree that it was a slip, but are you sure it was Freudian?
0,0,0,So, how do you feel when people say you're not really a fish?
0,0,0,So, you're worried that girls don't find you appealing.
0,0,0," Then she said 'I would be just as appealing .'
0,0,0,How long was it after he slipped that you began to have these feelings of guilt?
0,0,0,Find you appealing?
0,0,0,I'm guessing you won't fall for the Freudian slip gag.
0,0,0,Why has no one ever fallen for me?
0,0,0,I was the only one in my bunch who didn't make Chiquita.
0,0,0,Why do you feel you have a propensity to cause Freudian slips?
0,0,0,Firstly, it's unethical for me to date a patient. And secondly, you're a banana.
0,0,0,I sense your slipping away from me.
0,0,0,I'm afraid you're suffering from a severe case of split personality disorder.
0,0,0,My mother mother My mother also had a split personality.
0,0,0,You feel like something's missing inside?
0,0,0,...and then there was the time my own Freuder –ahem– father, slipped on me!
0,0,0,So when did you realize you were male?
0,0,0,Now, just tell me what's eating you.
0,0,0,I know you have a peel, but it is not good for your mental health to think that everyone falls for you.
0,0,0,Let's go back to the mustachioed man and the day of the crash.
0,0,0,So you suspect monkey business?
0,0,0,I peel like a joke.
0,0,0,No, euphemistic banana split is not a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,A peeling is not appealing.
0,0,0,You feel rejected because of the color of your skin?
0,0,0,jklfsad;jkl
0,0,0,It's okay; I am used to Freudian slips in here.
0,0,0,You say you feel empty?
0,0,0,So tell me - how are you peeling today?
0,0,0,So talk to me about why you believe people fall on you all the time.
0,0,0,Tell me how you imagine that you would act out your foot fetish?
0,0,0,Being the but of all those jokes must be challenging.
0,0,0,let's discuss why you believe you're unappealing
0,0,0,You're really beginning to open up.
0,0,0,So... how does it make you feel when your father calls you 'monkey trash?'
0,0,0,I'm not denying your appeal, but I am your doctor.
0,0,0,I just feel so used and discarded.
0,0,0,People really need to look where they're going. It's not your fault.
0,0,0,Causing harm to others may be morally indefensible, but when I picture it, it still makes me laugh.
0,0,0,Why can't you accept the fact that you're a very appealing banana peel?
0,0,0,Tell me about the things in life that you find appealing.
0,0,0,I'd like to see you again next sundae.
0,0,0,I had the weirdest dream last night that I turned into a phalluc symbol
0,0,0,[HUH? I just today received my New Yorker depicting birds and hunter!!! For which my submission was: "Gun nuthatch!"]
0,0,0,I'm sorry to hear about your boyfriend, but bananas split all the time.
0,0,0,I said 'slippery'. It's a clinical term.
0,0,0,Mr. Dole, I can help you peel away each of your concerns. Let's begin with your lack of taste.
0,0,0,How long have you felt unappealing?
0,0,0,You don't need a therapist to put you back together, you need a zipper.
0,0,0,So you have this recurring nightmare that you're human?
0,0,0,You know in my day I was Top Banana.
0,0,0,I wonder if you unconsciously want people to slip and fall.
0,0,0,Was it more than a Freudian Slip?
0,0,0,You should try to be more thick-skinned.
0,0,0,Your Open Mic nights at the Comedy Club seem to be working. I'm just a little upset myself at the 2 drink minimum.
0,0,0,Yes, people don't actually slip on you, but maybe you should try to be happy that you are getting work. Think about your poor cousin, the pineapple skin.
0,0,0,I'm sure she finds you a-peeling.
0,0,0,Let's talk about the incident with the gorilla.
0,0,0,Your separation anxiety seems to be tripping up everyone you meet.
0,0,0,Taxes give many people anxiety.
0,0,0,Well, it's about what is on the inside that matters, and maybe that is your problem.
0,0,0,So how long have you had this fear of monkeys?
0,0,0,Animal, vegetable, or mineral. My rates are all the same.
0,0,0,So, you feel used by the clown?
0,0,0,I'm sure we can work out a payment option somehow.
0,0,0,When did you first know you are actually a starfish?
0,0,0,Great, another manspreader...
0,0,0,Do these episodes always occur in bunches?
0,0,0,So, people don't fall for you?
0,0,0,My diagnosis, is a "Split Personality".
0,0,0,Don't be so hard on yourself. You're not an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,Maybe you should embrace the fact that you can be funny and scary at the same instant.
0,0,0,Unless we deal with your constant need of being the Top Banana, you will slowly peel away.
0,0,0,So you feel like you're empty inside?
0,0,0,Why do you think she just slipped away?
0,0,0,What do YOU think a 60-year-old Austrian psychoanalyst in your dreams means?
0,0,0,I think we're done here.
0,0,0,I'm sorry, you are right, I shouldn't refer to it as a slip. Would you please elaborate about your relapse.
0,0,0,Mhm ... and how does that make you peel?
0,0,0,Yes, I can charge on a sliding scale...
0,0,0,Maybe it's time for you to accept that marbles are just funnier.
0,0,0,It's good to know you are letting yourself peel again.
0,0,0,She said I lacked a certain appeal.
0,0,0,Do you think falling down is actually funny?
0,0,0,You're not a joke.
0,0,0,When did you first feel like 'an accident waiting to happen.'?
0,0,0,I just feel like everything is slipping by me!
0,0,0,The Fosters, The Cream Pies, the Splits...all signs of a masochist.
0,0,0,You'll be fine -- I deal with splits all the time.
0,0,0,You're not responsible for someone else's slip
0,0,0,Let's begin with why you feel like you are prone to so many slipups.
0,0,0,I loved my mother and father, but I did feel hostility toward the rest of the bunch.
0,0,0,Doesn't it feel better to open up?
0,0,0,So how did you feel when she said she was no longer happy to see you?
0,0,0,All right, Norman Vincent, let's get started.
0,0,0,Envy of potato skins is perfectly normal
0,0,0,When did you begin to feel you were just a shell of your former self?
0,0,0,Michael, you're bruising! I need you to tell me what's wrong.
0,0,0,When exactly did your obsession with Jerry Lewis begin?
0,0,0,I've felt so empty since the split.
0,0,0,Do you understand your life is a joke
0,0,0,So you’re getting a job at the slippery slope.
0,0,0,The split must have been hard on you.
0,0,0,I'm going to be brutally honest. You're an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,And when did you first start having these thoughts - that you'll wind up on the street?
0,0,0,Don't internalize blame -- it is his own fault he slipped on you. Howard F. Taylor, Princeton, N. J.
0,0,0,So, you were torn from the bunch at an unripe age. How did that make you peel?
0,0,0,True progress, Chiquita. You're starting to peel away the layers.
0,0,0,You're not crazy, Mr. Cavendish, you're just 'bananas.'
0,0,0,Why do you feel like you have a split personality?
0,0,0,I just haven't been peeling right
0,0,0,I’m not falling for that one again.
0,0,0,Why does it bother you to been seen as slippery ?
0,0,0,Sure people are falling for you, but I don't think it's your magnetic personality."
0,0,0,And that's when you let her slip away?
0,0,0,I'm sick and tired of being the butt of terrible jokes.
0,0,0,So, you feel the monkey just used you.
0,0,0,This is clear evidence of a split personality.
0,0,0,You have banana split personality syndrome.
0,0,0,And how does the split make you peel?
0,0,0,Keep it in your peel! I'm not that kind of therapist.
0,0,0,What do you mean when you say you sometimes go bananas?
0,0,0,What was it like, being a member in a big hand?
0,0,0,I'm not a piece of meat.
0,0,0,Why do you think you feel so empty?
0,0,0,And why do you think you don't feel complete?
0,0,0,I can slip you in for your next appointment in a week.
0,0,0,So you’re saying that when daylight come, they all wanna go home?
0,0,0,What makes you feel empty inside?
0,0,0,Do you remember when you lost your soul?
0,0,0,I hope you don't mind. I worked through lunch.
0,0,0,How long have you felt your appeal was slipping.
0,0,0,Most definitely, you have a banana split personality.
0,0,0,Just ignore them. I find your puns appealing.
0,0,0,So, what I hear you saying is though you take no joy in the misfortune of others, you feel it's your responsibility to be the integral component in the schadenfraude equation?
0,0,0,So, why do you think everyone falls for you?
0,0,0,You say you feel empty inside. Tell me about your mother
0,0,0,I think it's time to stop blaming your mother.
0,0,0,In our last session; you spoke of safety concerns with your job at the ice cream...
0,0,0,Doc, you don't get it! People are always try to avoid me in the streets.
0,0,0,And how did you feel when he called you a fruit?
0,0,0,It's not your fault.
0,0,0,Well, I find you "appealing".
0,0,0,So, you just split?
0,0,0,So I said let's split and she laughed.
0,0,0,An prescription of ice cream, sprinkles and a spoon are usually successful in cases such as yours.
0,0,0,Did our foreplay make up for eating you?
0,0,0,I've tried Viagra and Cialis, nothing works. She slipped out of our apartment.
0,0,0,'Tell me when this feeling of being slippery began.'
0,0,0,And so I told him, "I wasn't asking to be eaten because I wore this."
0,0,0,My girlfriend says I'm all appeal , and no substance!
0,0,0,How often do you have this dream about hungry monkeys?
0,0,0,Look. I don't think that just because you wear yellow, that you must drive the Truly Nolen car, but then, that just my personal opinion.
0,0,0,Why do you feel like your emptiness is inherently comic?
0,0,0,I know I've been in this business too long when I start answering your questions!
0,0,0,Your girlfriend is a fern?
0,0,0,Even empty and discarded, I find you appealing.
0,0,0,It says here that you switched therapists because the last one 'slipped up'
0,0,0,I know I make you feel empty inside but let's focus on how you felt before I put you in the blender.
0,0,0,And why do you feel your life is just a big joke?
0,0,0,You have appeal, but you seem to be lacking substance.
0,0,0,A diagnoses of "he went bananas" is so 80's.
0,0,0,You have stem envy.
0,0,0,So you would say that leaving the others in the bunch was liberating at first, right?
0,0,0,They always blame me for Freudian slips.
0,0,0,You may want to check your potassium. I think you are over medicated.
0,0,0,Our time is up, but I want to continue exploring the incident at the smoothie shop when we meet next week.
0,0,0,But then you laughed anyway.
0,0,0,How did you end up on skid row?
0,0,0,About an hour ago I woke up in the garbage can with this empty feeling.
0,0,0,Stop hiding behind your excoriations and rise up to your expectations!
0,0,0,No, you could not have caused a Freudian slip!
0,0,0,Do you blame yourself for her slip?
0,0,0,You're a fruit. Get used to it.
0,0,0,There was a bunch of us when growing up but we've all been split.
0,0,0,Did you ever consider that it might not always be the slope that is slippery?
0,0,0,Before we start, I think you should know I'm more of a Jungian anal-ist...err!
0,0,0,And how often do you have these nightmares about being stepped on?
0,0,0,Success.
0,0,0,Admitting that the slip was Freudian has been a major breakthrough.
0,0,0,I think you are suffering from Plantain envy.
0,0,0,For the last time, I won't write a prescription for Viagra because it won't help you with that.
0,0,0,…and then you unzipped me…and then you smothered me in whipped cream…and then you stuck in a sweet red cherry...and then you licked it off…and then you plunged me into your mouth…and then you sank your teeth into me…
0,0,0,Yes, I agree, perhaps you should have seen it coming, but honestly, it happens every single day.
0,0,0,And when he slipped, how did that make you peel?
0,0,0,You are headed down a slippery slope.
0,0,0,No, I am not a Freudian. Why do you ask?
0,0,0,Now we can peel back and get to your core.
0,0,0,So, you are not peeling very well?
0,0,0,You don't have to let your mother's split personality define you.
0,0,0,You'd rather be empty than risk going soft.
0,0,0,Clinically speaking, you've clearly gone bananas.
0,0,0,So tell me more about the split.
0,0,0,I feel so used.....it's not my fault they keep slipping.
0,0,0,Have you considered taking a break from social media?
0,0,0,Yes, it is an unusually long time to remain in the phallic stage.
0,0,0,Please forgive me. I peeled away your vulnerable facade and devoured your inner self.
0,0,0,No, my name is not Miss Muffet.
0,0,0,...and you feel responsible for your parents split?
0,0,0,How do you mean, you feel like an accident waiting to happen?
0,0,0,You say you slipped up. But how exactly?
0,0,0,I will thank the nuts for the referral, but I don't think food-related, psychological stigmatism is really the issue. I think it's more like separation anxiety.
0,0,0,I just can't shake this feeling that people are avoiding me.
0,0,0,And why do you feel like you're always the fall guy?
0,0,0,It's normal to feel some guilt when you believe you've caused a person to slip and have an accident.
0,0,0,You give new meaning to a "Freudian slip".
0,0,0,I only booed once and then I was smashed into a cleshay.
0,0,0,You are a danger to others.
0,0,0,It's like a part of me is missing.
0,0,0,I really feel like she got me to open up and then she just took out my insides and threw me away.
0,0,0,You should forget mellow yellow
0,0,0,I told you not to split!
0,0,0,You say your Freudian slips suddenly multiplied just before you went totally bananas?
0,0,0,Chiquita, the question is why did he put you in the refrigerator?
0,0,0,Let's talk about what's getting under your skin.
0,0,0,How do you say you are doing the opposite of coming out of your shell?
0,0,0,When did you first realize you were going bananas?
0,0,0,Well you may have lost your inner self, but you still have appeal
0,0,0,And why do you always refer to Monkey's as bastards ?
0,0,0,Of course you have separation issues, you're a bloody banana.
0,0,0,We are going to try and "appeal" to your sudden feelings of being worthless.
0,0,0,Let's talk about your Mother. That can be a slippery slope.
0,0,0,And how was your relationship with Luigi?
0,0,0,I understand your fears, Barry, but comedy changes and so must you.
0,0,0,It's not a homophobic slur, you are a fruit.
0,0,0,I'm the shrink...not you.
0,0,0,I can see why you feel discarded.
0,0,0,If you're going to let people walk all over you, at least make it hurt.
0,0,0,really were did you ditch the monkey
0,0,0,I think you're slipping.
0,0,0,Yes, but the people who fall and hit their heads don't really care if the slip is Freudian or not.
0,0,0,So what your telling me is that YOU... coined the phrase "The bigger they are the harder they fall"
0,0,0,He slipped. It's not your fault.
0,0,0,You have appeal but no substance.
0,0,0,So you think it's just everyone else's fault they keep falling down?
0,0,0,Stop calling me bananas, dammit!
0,0,0,Funny how you let that slip.
0,0,0,Is there rigid banana flesh under your peel, or are you just happy to see me?
0,0,0,Don't torture yourself. We all have separation anxiety.
0,0,0,It sounds like you need more potassium.
0,0,0,Daylight comes, sure, but the truth is you can't go home...
0,0,0,Why do you think they call you a bully?
0,0,0,It's not how society sees you, but how you see yourself, Chiquito.
0,0,0,You've even got me baffled!
0,0,0,She took my properties and dumped me.
0,0,0,No, the Freudian slip didn't happen that way.
0,0,0,Next session we'll examine the Freudian slips!
0,0,0,Oh, no, no - "low hanging fruit" is just a metaphor.
0,0,0,I gave her the slip, and now she's suing.
0,0,0,If you were the Invisible _Gentleman_ you'd use a fig leaf.
0,0,0,I feel like everyone thinks I'm just a big joke.
0,0,0,I feel so old...yesterday someone called me a Bananagram.
0,0,0,Feeling a little empty inside?
0,0,0,Don't blame yourself...It's not always your fault every time she slips up.
0,0,0,I told you the flesh was weak.
0,0,0,You've got a split personality
0,0,0,Apparently he's sold that chump on that "one in hand is worth two in the bush" nonsense!
0,0,0,Believe me, I know what it's like to be stepped on.
0,0,0,I have a vindictive nature
0,0,0,I didn't realize how traumatized banana peel would be without banana
0,0,0,Peeling better?
0,0,0,The people who seem to be problem-less, often have the most.
0,0,0,You realize, of course, I can never do that again.
0,0,0,So it is the feelings of inadequacy and lack of recognition for making the actual Freud slip...?
0,0,0,How does this stereotyping as something to slip on make you feel?
0,0,0,I'm not sure we can peel anymore layers away..
0,0,0,For your significant other, don't you want more than just low-hanging fruit?
0,0,0,And when the man called you "slippery", how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,Sure people blame you too much for their falls, but I am sensing some real guilt here, too.
0,0,0,My life has been characterized by a long slippery slope.
0,0,0,Don't think of yourself as garbage. Remember it's what's on the inside that counts.
0,0,0,Sometimes I feel like a fruit; sometimes I don't.
0,0,0,How long have you been feeling you life's a joke?
0,0,0,That sounds like a classic case of transference.
0,0,0,I can't explain it, Doctor. Nothing appeals to me, and I just feel so empty inside.
0,0,0,Have you considered not trying to be funny all the time?
0,0,0,Then she said dating me was a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I can understand you're feeling used.
0,0,0,Let's talk about your childhood.
0,0,0,And when she said, "Sometimes a banana is just a good smoothie," how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,I just don't know how to cope with all my peelings anymore.
0,0,0,You do understand that when you say you want to "slip me one" it's called "transference", right?
0,0,0,She slipped. She fell. Get over it.
0,0,0,I love bananas, but you are a left-over from my one o'clock.
0,0,0,Yes, sometimes you cause people to slip and hurt themselves but it's not your fault and you mustn't feel any guilt.
0,0,0,And how does being cliche' make you feel?
0,0,0,Maybe a split is just what your relationship needs.
0,0,0,Do you feel like everyone is stepping on you often?
0,0,0,Wow, that must have been traumatic for you. But how did that make you Peel?
0,0,0,Seriously?
0,0,0,Would you describe your emotional state as peeled right now?
0,0,0,What I'm hearing you say, is that at least that experience didn't turn you into a vegetable.
0,0,0,Your appeal? Only skin deep.
0,0,0," SO TELL ME HOW YOU FELT LOSING MR. STEED?.
0,0,0,Doc, I feel like my wife is slipping away from me.
0,0,0,Give up puns? I appeal to you.
0,0,0,... and we knew you'd be confronting new challenges, post gender-affirming surgery.
0,0,0,Remember, it's what's inside that counts.
0,0,0,Why do you always get the bigger chair?
0,0,0,I want to be a serious actor, but people just walk all over me.
0,0,0,You seem to be perking up a bit.
0,0,0,So why do you feel so unappeeling?
0,0,0,Split personality? Self-diagnosis is not usually a good idea.
0,0,0,When did you first discover you were accident prone?
0,0,0,To put it bluntly , you're both bruised and empty .
0,0,0,this is the first time I've taken dictation from an alien being so please speak slowly
0,0,0,You were saying you feel all eaten up inside. . .
0,0,0,Let's see if I understand: your father says to relax and he'll make sure no one slips on you, your mother says you already are a twirly skirt, and your brother won't talk to you like you are now.
0,0,0,Special? No -- I'd say your anger's pedestrian.
0,0,0,When you say he "fell for you,' you're speaking metaphorically, I assume?
0,0,0,I prefer the term "erectile dysfunction".
0,0,0,To counter your negative self-image, I want you to look in the mirror each morning and repeat, ‘I am appealing to others. I am appealing to others.’ Oh, wait—darn! Another Freudian slip!
0,0,0,I appreciate your commitment to continuing therapy, Mr. Ferguson... But why a banana peel?
0,0,0,I just feel like I'm missing something.
0,0,0,How do you feel about your lack of an inner banana?
0,0,0,Now, Mr. banana peel you said you like to give people the slip... tell me more about that.
0,0,0,Freudian slip? No way - peel off!
0,0,0,I just feel like people are always stepping on me.
0,0,0,So, tell me how you're peeling?
0,0,0,You've been through a horrible trauma. It's okay to feel empty inside.
0,0,0,And just like that the Grauer Gorilla was gone.
0,0,0,Do *you* think you're a well-worn trope?
0,0,0,We've finally stripped off your peel and reached the core of your problems.
0,0,0,So, how did that make you peel, er, I mean feel?
0,0,0,What I hear you saying is that being the subject of lame, slap-stick humor can lead to feelings of emptiness.
0,0,0,When that woman slipped, tell me how that made you feel.
0,0,0,Don't feel bad. Fruedian slips are not your fault.
0,0,0,Bananas Foster could have been a good nickname. Top banana might not have been a great fit for you.
0,0,0,It's a classic case of separation anxiety.
0,0,0,We need to peel back your memories so hopefully you won't slip up again.
0,0,0,No one can make you feel like trash without your permission.
0,0,0,And if my legs are much hotter than yours?
0,0,0,I think to focus on what you have lost would be fruitless.
0,0,0,I just feel like something is missing inside.
0,0,0,We all feel divided some times....
0,0,0,So you've been feeling slippery lately. When did this begin?
0,0,0,I'm afraid you suffer from an Edible Complex.
0,0,0,Tell me why you think you no longer are 'appealing'?
0,0,0,I apologize for wearing heels today... I will make a note that they are a trigger for your anxiety.
0,0,0,You're saying you made a Freudian slip...literally?
0,0,0,And how does that make you peel... I mean, feel?
0,0,0,He slipped, he fell. You've got to stop blaming yourself.
0,0,0,You feel nobody finds you a peeling?
0,0,0,Just start by telling me how you peel.
0,0,0,I need your advice. I slipped up again.
0,0,0,So, you say you are splitting up?
0,0,0,My new in-laws are a bunch of nuts.
0,0,0,I think there might be a link between your sense of internal emptiness and your compulsion to make people slip up in public.
0,0,0,Interesting, but I do hope my therapist shows up soon.
0,0,0,What matters is whether you believe our sessions have become fruitless.
0,0,0,Have you considered that maybe it's not you that they're laughing at?
0,0,0,You were so...there.
0,0,0,How long have you self-identified as an apple?
0,0,0,So, why don't you think it was an accident?
0,0,0,So tell me about this Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Sleeping with you would be inappropriate. I ate you because I missed lunch. That's all.
0,0,0,I don't feel complete, as if something's missing.
0,0,0,What's got you split three ways?
0,0,0,I just feel like no matter what I do I'm always letting things slip
0,0,0,Yes, the inner soul is rarely as beautiful as the outer.
0,0,0,No, I said we'd peel back the onion layers.
0,0,0,Tell me more about your plaintain.
0,0,0,I see your inner you decided to skip our session.
0,0,0,Your performance at work has been slipping?
0,0,0,May I assume there are no more letters for today, Mr. Kong?
0,0,0,So when did you start blaming yourself for the slips of others?
0,0,0,If you feel like a vegetable, it does not necessarily mean you're schizophrenic
0,0,0,Did your fear of being composted start before or after peeling?
0,0,0,Your inner mind has devoured itself.
0,0,0,It's what's on the inside that counts.
0,0,0,Yes, but for a peel, but you have appeal.
0,0,0,We have to peel back some layers to get to the root of your fear of gorillas.
0,0,0,I thought this was ripe crisis counseling.
0,0,0,How do you mean, "You feel like garbage?"
0,0,0,The issue is too much positive reinforcement for your hurtful actions against others.
0,0,0,After what you've experienced I'm not suprised that you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,These slips of yours need to stop.
0,0,0,Yes, you made her fall for you. But you really hurt her in the process.
0,0,0,Ah, well, that's a bit of a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Slipped up again, eh?
0,0,0,Feed me Seymour! Is that all you ever think about?
0,0,0,Relax, I'm organic.
0,0,0,Have you talked to a doctor about getting it reattached?
0,0,0,Sit back. Relax. You're getting very slippery.
0,0,0,Yes, that must've been difficult... how close were you before learning the banana bread wasn't gluten free?
0,0,0,Tell me why you think the coconut, cantaloupe and pineapple make you feel inadequate?
0,0,0,Maybe not everyone wants to be swept off their feet
0,0,0,No. I don't think you're nuts; but you may be bananas
0,0,0,Don't judge yourself. A bad split can be hard to handle.
0,0,0,Do you need a tissue?
0,0,0,Perhaps we need to put you in bunch therapy
0,0,0,My life's a total joke!
0,0,0,Was it really that funny?
0,0,0,This guilt...is it that you blame yourself for their slip? Or because you also laugh at them?
0,0,0,Sometimes everyone feels a little empty.
0,0,0,You have nightmares about being hung from a tree?
0,0,0,Can you be more specific, Mr. B., in describing how your performance has suffered?
0,0,0,I'm having trouble getting any traction in my work.
0,0,0,Let's talk more about your parent's split.
0,0,0,At some point you'll have to get a grip.
0,0,0,No. I've never has a Banana Split Sundae.
0,0,0,You still miss your inner self?
0,0,0,Would you feel better if we used the expression ‘Going nuts’ instead?
0,0,0,As your therapist and a woman, I do find you appealing.
0,0,0,So we both have body language issues.
0,0,0,I feel my life is just slipping away.
0,0,0,With body language like that, no wonder you've been stalked.
0,0,0,. . . and you think that last slip might have been a Freudian one?
0,0,0,We don't use the phrase "he went bananas" anymore, but in your case ...
0,0,0,What if it's what's on the inside that matters?
0,0,0,Let's talk about your tendency to slip into patterns.
0,0,0,Actually, you cause more of a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,And how does it make you feel when people call you 'slippery'?
0,0,0,So tell me, how do you peel?
0,0,0,Very interesting, Mr. Smith. Now tell me how you really peel?
0,0,0,Soo... what say we slip you outta that dress?
0,0,0,A banana for your thoughts
0,0,0,It's so difficult for me to peel back any more layers
0,0,0,Lets unpack why you think you are responsible for every split in your relationships.
0,0,0,And when did you first notice everything was slipping away?
0,0,0,So, how long have you been experiencing these peelings?
0,0,0,So when he stepped on you, how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,I have a lot of patients with a split personality
0,0,0,And...how long have you had this empty feeling inside?
0,0,0,Your feeling of emptiness could be related to a bunch of issues
0,0,0,Please try to pull yourself together.
0,0,0,Why do you believe only clowns fall for you?
0,0,0,Before I knew it there was chocolate syrup, whipped cream and not one, not two... but three types of ice cream." "I am diagnosing you with Post Traumatic Split Disorder. Keep journaling and we will meet next week.
0,0,0,Well, this has been a fruitful session
0,0,0,Are you feeling guilty because you thought it was Freud?
0,0,0,You're a piece of inedible garbage, deal with it
0,0,0,It's a clear cut case of banana split personality.
0,0,0,How would you actually feel, though, if I agreed to step on you?
0,0,0,"Continual denial is bringing you right back to that slippery slope".
0,0,0,So he ran off with a little Chiquita, eh?
0,0,0,I'm really not comfortable with you sitting there judging me for how I use your better half.
0,0,0,Slipped up again, did we?
0,0,0,I've never heard of a Freudian slip and fall. What's that like for you?
0,0,0,I'm so sorry. It must be difficult to no longer be a sex object.
0,0,0,So you're glad you're not an orange?
0,0,0,You're letting people walk all over you, Kyle, and that's a slippery slope.
0,0,0,So he left you for a sundae?
0,0,0,What does it really mean to not be comfortable in your own skin
0,0,0,No, you're not at all appealing in that way.
0,0,0,No, I am not going to slip into something more comfortable.
0,0,0,I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden.
0,0,0,So, tell me about this vegetable you were so attached to.
0,0,0,So you're giving up your acting career to study the saxophone?
0,0,0,Looks like your past life regression therapy was a huge success.
0,0,0,Let's role play—I'll be the banana peel and you be the one slipping
0,0,0,I've been robbed of my sex appeal.
0,0,0,I've been stepped on my entire life.
0,0,0,Why don't you begin by telling me how you managed to break away from the bunch. Did you just "slip" out of sight?
0,0,0,I understand how you must puh... feel.
0,0,0,So the split was really hard on you.
0,0,0,I think that we can both agree that what you've lost in substance, Mr. Banana, you've gained in soul.
0,0,0,Actually, I charge by the hour, not per pound. Why do you ask?
0,0,0,I hear you saying you feel empty and wonder if you still have appeal?
0,0,0,Forgive and accept. People slip.
0,0,0,okay, instead of discussing your vulnerability, let's make a small shift and discuss your culpability
0,0,0,So tell me more about your tree...
0,0,0,You say you want me to walk on you?
0,0,0,So you feel your partner doesn't have appeal?
0,0,0,She said I'm bananas and have no appeal.
0,0,0,A bird on the barrel is worth 2 in the bush.
0,0,0,You're neurotic, NOT bananas.
0,0,0,My case is being tried in the court of a-peel next week
0,0,0,No wonder you make slip-ups.
0,0,0,You're right. I don't think it's funny.
0,0,0,Your life has to be built on more than appeal.
0,0,0,Don't blame yourself! He took a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,You're not going to slip it to me again.
0,0,0,Why do you believe you’ve lost appeal?
0,0,0,So you've been slipping back into the same old habits?
0,0,0,So you think you've lost your banana.
0,0,0,Sorry, we only do couple's therapy.
0,0,0,He hollowed me out then treated me like garbage.
0,0,0,In therapy, we like to peel back your issues, do you think you might slip up?
0,0,0,...and future sessions will be prepaid.
0,0,0,Sure he slipped and fell. But what about MY pain?
0,0,0,So he slipped, but you were bruised?
0,0,0,And why do you think she no longer finds you appealing?
0,0,0,So you've been feeling empty since the split.
0,0,0,I was told to come and see you about making a Freudian slip
0,0,0,You have to stop blaming yourself if others find you unappealing.
0,0,0,Now you are upset, because I couldn't resist eating you.
0,0,0,Unfortunately at your age I don't think you'll ever recover what you've lost.
0,0,0,Have I been reading too much Freud, or are you just glad to see me?
0,0,0,And you say you made a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,I don't know, doc. I just feel so empty inside.
0,0,0,So, you say it's Splitsville.
0,0,0,Yes, I understand you think those slipups were your doing, but there are wider forces in the universe you don't understand....
0,0,0,It's not your fault he slipped and on fell on you.
0,0,0,You 'peeled away' before our session ended?!
0,0,0,Nobody has stepped on you in three months? Wow
0,0,0,She's helping him not 'Rot Out'
0,0,0,I know you don't like to talk about your ex, but we need to discuss the split
0,0,0,I just feel like I've lost who I am inside.
0,0,0,Therapist to Mr. Banana Peel: Wow! That is a tough situation! I really peel for you.
0,0,0,It seems like every guy I meet ends up falling for me...
0,0,0,This Trump hairpiece idea is a delusion.
0,0,0,Sometimes the emotional bruises can hurt worse.
0,0,0,When did you begin to experience friction?
0,0,0,Let's start with why you think everyone blames you.
0,0,0,How does that make you peel? Can you also describe this peeling in 5 words or less?
0,0,0,How long have you been feeling that you've been used ?
0,0,0,Lance, first admit it was cheating.
0,0,0,I hear that you feel cold and empty since the split.
0,0,0,How long have you felt that you were more of a plantain?
0,0,0,Don't be so upset, "going bananas" doesn't refer to you
0,0,0,You can't let one slip up bring you down.
0,0,0,Used, tossed away, empty inside? We could swap notes, pal.
0,0,0,I feel like rubbish.
0,0,0,..and that's when I realized it was me who was slipping on them
0,0,0,We need to peel back the layers to find the underlying problem.
0,0,0,What's the icda 10 code for this visit?
0,0,0,Do you identify as a banana or a plantain?
0,0,0,You're worried about your a peel.
0,0,0,So how long has the eggplant emoji made you feel inadequate?
0,0,0,Organic? Of course not, he had a very conservative world view.
0,0,0,I thought, "hey, he wants to eat healthy for once." Instead, he put me in the microwave. The husky teenage boy I live with would never use an apple pie. He just wanted a warm place to put it. He'll do it again, Doc.
0,0,0,This is complex; I'll have to unpeel several layers of your personality.
0,0,0,I understand your separation anxiety when you split.
0,0,0,I understand you lost nearly everything after the split.
0,0,0,Um OK: Slippery relationships, change happens quickly, you never knew your mother. What else?
0,0,0,So you think you're a catalyzing force in people's demise?
0,0,0,How do you feel when people call you "slippery?"
0,0,0,Thanks Doc, I'm back in the zone
0,0,0,How long has this been eating you alive inside?
0,0,0,Am I hearing you say that your life no longer bears fruit?
0,0,0,Maybe ED is not the best term for this sense of loss you're feeling.
0,0,0,And which Freudian did you make slip?
0,0,0,I see you've already met my therapy dog.
0,0,0,So, tell me more about this feeling of emptiness you say you've been experiencing.
0,0,0,Now that you've finally opened up, I can see that you're truly empty inside.
0,0,0,Tell me about your fear of monkeys.
0,0,0,'' But Nana, tell me why you feel so empty.''
0,0,0,I think you've finally reached the stage of acceptance.
0,0,0,I just feel so empty inside
0,0,0,You can't peel back more layers, or you won't?
0,0,0,"I am more than just a slip up".
0,0,0,When I said, "let's peel back some layers," I did not mean physically...
0,0,0,Not every fruit gets to have zest.
0,0,0,I didn't say your were bananas, I meant you must be bananas
0,0,0,OK, so then she said she wanted a banana split?
0,0,0,You can't blame your mother because you're a fruit.
0,0,0,So you think that your life has just been one big joke waiting to happen?
0,0,0,I feel I'm appealing, but some see me as a big joke
0,0,0,I just feel like a mere peel of my former self.
0,0,0,When did this feeling of abandonment start?
0,0,0,You've started down a slippery slope.
0,0,0,So, this feeling you have of being always being the punchline to a joke, Where does it come from?
0,0,0,So your saying you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,And for how long have you been wanting to make a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,I'm tired of being blamed for everybody's slip ups!
0,0,0,Sometimes a banana is only a banana. And now our time is up.
0,0,0,I can see now why your wife left you for a cucumber.
0,0,0,Why do you feel the work we're doing is fruitless?
0,0,0,I heard you the first time and it wasn't funny then either.
0,0,0,If you were a fruit, what fruit would you be?
0,0,0,The outer beauty is what really matters.
0,0,0,Whoever told you that you were a worthless piece of trash; They were right. You are a worthless piece of trash.
0,0,0,I can see by your colouring that our time is up.
0,0,0,I just feel used.
0,0,0,After he split, everything slipped away.
0,0,0,Your body is nicer than me. How did you reduce the body fat percentage?
0,0,0,Is that a banana or are you just glad to see me?
0,0,0,Now tell me what's going on inside.
0,0,0,So tell me when you started feeling so empty inside.
0,0,0,I'm not trash !
0,0,0,Don't worry - we all feel like we're going bananas some days.
0,0,0,Such feelings of emptiness are not uncommon.
0,0,0,Separation anxiety is very common among your species.
0,0,0,So, you've felt empty ever since your split?
0,0,0,I just don't feel like I'm funny anymore.
0,0,0,No, I wouldn't say you're not appealing.
0,0,0,So, you say you've been villainized in the media. Can you expound on that?
0,0,0,You're just experiencing common feelings of separation anxiety.
0,0,0,When did you begin to feel like a second?
0,0,0,Now..., you say you were referred to me by an existing patient?
0,0,0,Why do you think you have a split personality?
0,0,0,It's not my fault if people trip over me.
0,0,0,Do you always feel that you are about to injure someone?
0,0,0,It's NOT your fault, it was a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,One way we can work through his is by accepting you have a slippery side.
0,0,0,i'm sorry i ever introduced you to cheetah
0,0,0,So what makes you think your life is just a joke?
0,0,0,Elaborate on how you and your bunch slipped across the border.
0,0,0,I prefer not to be called Chiquita.
0,0,0,That *is* the technical term for your condition.
0,0,0,When the fault is clearly not yours, you must let it slide. So to speak.
0,0,0,And how long have you self-identified as an avocado?
0,0,0,I feel so empty and used! I also sense a lack of purpose.
0,0,0,I'm so sorry to hear about your parents' split.
0,0,0,Have you been feeling emty on the inside lately?
0,0,0,So today i wanted us to focus on your bananal fixation.
0,0,0,You were hanging with your friends, went home to Lorena, then what?
0,0,0,I'll never be anything but a punchline
0,0,0,It's time you made clear boundaries, ones that keep you very far away from feet.
0,0,0,At your age it's normal to slip a little.
0,0,0,Clearly that ice cream parlor incident led to your split personality
0,0,0,I'm terribly sorry. I skipped lunch.
0,0,0,"You keep saying 'slippery slope,' doctor. It's a little offensive, really.
0,0,0,Okay, Mrs. Banane, I understand your concern about the slips, but worrying about "Yes, we have no bananas" is a bunch of catastrophizing.
0,0,0,So, Ms. Chiquita, have you read Kafka's Metamorphosis?
0,0,0,Sounds like a Freudian slip
0,0,0,You're tired of slippery jokes, I get that; but let's peel back another layer.
0,0,0,I'm tempted to ask how that makes you peel.
0,0,0,I witnessed my brother get peeled alive and turned into a smoothie when I was 3.
0,0,0,I peeled first, now you.
0,0,0,So, what do you think your appeal is?
0,0,0,It's my professional opinion that you are an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,I was stripped and left for dead; you shouldn't be surprised that I retaliated by tripping him.
0,0,0,Honestly, I don't think I'd even recognize this Key person you keep talking about.
0,0,0,Two Walls
0,0,0,Actually, you look very ap"peel"ing!
0,0,0,You're not THAT appealing.
0,0,0,And how long has it been since you landed a dramatic role?
0,0,0,And how does that make you peel? I feel like something is missing inside.
0,0,0,Being second is also valuable.
0,0,0,So, you think you are responsible for the slipups of others?
0,0,0,And just why do you think people tip-toe around you?
0,0,0,Does Mrs. Peel know about the slip-and-fall lawsuits?
0,0,0,What's been harder, the slip or the split?
0,0,0,I really have fallen for you!
0,0,0,Now, how can we turn "I feel like some kind of accident magnet" into something less self-victimizing?
0,0,0,You have every right to feel "discarded"!
0,0,0,I'm just so sick of always being depicted as some hazard.
0,0,0,She mentioned your appeal? Or you're a peel.
0,0,0,So just face it, you're a slip and fall lawyer born in the wrong body.
0,0,0,Don't be so hard on yourself. Every top banana hits the skids.
0,0,0,Don't worry about it. It was only the result of a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,There's just something inside I feel is missing.
0,0,0,Pull your self together. By: Tommy Gibbons, Age 11
0,0,0,And you feel your spouse is slippery?
0,0,0,Everyone accuses me of making them slip and fall but that's a myth.
0,0,0,We're here for you to peel back the layers. Don't bunch it all up inside.
0,0,0,It's very tough to understand, I know. I just feel very empty inside.
0,0,0,I said, "Reveal your INNER self!
0,0,0,Would you like to discuss the split?
0,0,0,When did you first feel that you're slipping.
0,0,0,We were a fun bunch, now I feel totally ripped off and discarded.
0,0,0,Sorry, times up, I gotta split.
0,0,0,And why do you... feel guilty... when you didn't initiate the mishap?
0,0,0,Easy for you to say, you weren't born with a monkey on your back!
0,0,0,Not all bananas are destined to be top.
0,0,0,We've peeled away some of the issues that cause you to keep slipping.
0,0,0,You’re just feeling vulnerable right now.
0,0,0,I thought I was pure banana. Then, I found out my mother was a plantain.
0,0,0,In my case "going bananas" is not just an expression.
0,0,0,I didn't think he'd go that far back into his past.
0,0,0,Technically, what you experienced is not a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,So, tell me about your split.
0,0,0,The technical term for it is Dissociative Identity Disorder.
0,0,0,You are afraid of monkeys and have penis envy!
0,0,0,Sorry, I didn't hear that, I have a banana in my ear.
0,0,0,Tell me more about feeling you have lost your core essence.
0,0,0,Not to worry. You really are the top banana.
0,0,0,It was a Freudian slip, I swear.
0,0,0,Do you feel comfortable in your own skin?
0,0,0,Your peal is not a set of fingers and it has nothing to do with the size of your banana
0,0,0,I don't think she meant to say your existence was banal.
0,0,0,It must be hard to avoid feeling discarded.
0,0,0,So you thought the meant: we will see you on Sunday?
0,0,0,Yes Edna I did say if you want to beat depression you must have 100 percent skin in the game but you take things so literally
0,0,0,Do you think you WANTED him to slip?
0,0,0,You are what you are, Musa, a banana. Look it up!
0,0,0,We really peeled back some layers today.
0,0,0,My whole life has been a joke.....
0,0,0,Many of us feel empty at times.
0,0,0,I know, the composting craze has been trying for all of us.
0,0,0,Maybe people are laughing "with" you.
0,0,0,You fear being purposely thrown down so someone can slip on you?
0,0,0,Next week work on crossing your left leg over your right leg.
0,0,0,You have to REALLY want to change.
0,0,0,What's you rarliest memory of wanting to make someone slip?
0,0,0,You want to tell me about your "slip and fall".
0,0,0,We got into a big argument, and than she split.
0,0,0,I think we're making great progress about your physical insecurities despite the other bananas in the basket showing off.
0,0,0,You do realize in a couple of days none of this will matter.
0,0,0,Now about this sense you have that people are falling all over you ...
0,0,0,Let's not let anything slip through the cracks.
0,0,0,Are you here from Costa Rica LEGALLY?
0,0,0,You seem to be lacking substance.
0,0,0,How many times do I have to get stepped on before it's not funny anymore?
0,0,0,So you're saying you feel as if you lost the hero inside yourself.
0,0,0,Look, at least you're not a bad person ...
0,0,0,I just don't understand why I keep slipping everyone up.
0,0,0,Why do you hurt the people who are closest to you?
0,0,0,Actually, I see quite a few bananas.
0,0,0,Well you're no Clooney, but you do have a peel.
0,0,0,When he slipped, how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,They aren't laughing at you, they are laughing because of you.
0,0,0,Had you considered that perhaps they are laughing with you?
0,0,0,I sense an alienation from your inner core.
0,0,0,How long have you felt that you were just someone's "punch line"?
0,0,0,Tell me more about your bruised childhood.
0,0,0,Tell me about your rotten childhood.
0,0,0,So you're telling me that everyone says you bring them down, but you call them all clowns.
0,0,0,So, you think been consumed all consumed by this passion?
0,0,0,So you pursued a comedy career to compensate for your feelings of being discarded. Tell me more.
0,0,0,So, she split on Sundae?
0,0,0,Maybe slap-stick comedy just isn't you're calling!
0,0,0,Parents split; Sister’s a peeler; Brother’s bruised….We need to meet twice a week.
0,0,0,We already tried light therapy.
0,0,0,I lack appeal.
0,0,0,Say it.."I'm a fruit." Doesn't that feel good?
0,0,0,Tell me why you feel life is slipping away.
0,0,0,You sell a bit ripe.
0,0,0,Don't worry, you're not the first to make a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,So tell me, when did your life start slipping away?
0,0,0,I'm just tired of being stepped on doc like I'm some joke.
0,0,0,Let's see, at our last session we were discussing you're a peel to others. Shall we start there?
0,0,0,I think you lost your identity with all that knock knock stuff
0,0,0,So, how do you feel about your split?
0,0,0,It depends on what your definition of "slip" is.
0,0,0,You're really opening up today, that's a good thing.
0,0,0,Tell me again how he fell for you
0,0,0,Show me where the monkey touched you.
0,0,0,I've been speaking to your better half - and she told me the whole thing was YOUR fault.
0,0,0,“You feel failure because you went on a bowl of cereal instead of fulfilling a dream of being Bananas Foster?
0,0,0,You're upset over your split!
0,0,0,I agree. This is fruitless.
0,0,0,I think you might have a future in comedy.
0,0,0,When it comes to answering my questions, you are a slippery one!
0,0,0,Maybe you slip away from people too much
0,0,0,So, was it a painful split?
0,0,0,Mm-hmm..and can you describe what makes you feel used now?
0,0,0,Maybe it was just a freudian slip?
0,0,0,So you admit you do get pleasure from causing people pain?!
0,0,0,Sometimes a banana is just a banana peel.
0,0,0,So how did you FEEL when he took what he wanted, then just discarded you?
0,0,0,Quit looking so smug!
0,0,0,Interesting ... now can you tell me WHY the duck is sitting on your head?
0,0,0,And these women... They just fall for you?
0,0,0,O.K., so you gave him the slip. What happened next?
0,0,0,Now, does this emptiness you feel hit you before or after lunch?
0,0,0,You're not bananas; it's OK to feel empty inside.
0,0,0,I feel like my life has been slipping away from me.
0,0,0,So, tell me exactly what you mean, 'I feel like I'm not in my own skin.'
0,0,0,Watch out for a slippery slope
0,0,0,It sounds like someone used you and just split.
0,0,0,Once again we see the formidable hunter, totally in tune with his surroundings, continue on his quest for his elusive quarry.
0,0,0,You need to get out and mingle; maybe enter a nut-loaf.
0,0,0,I think you're showing early signs of PTSD
0,0,0,I didn't mean to offend you, I use 'fruit' as an umbrella term.
0,0,0,I just do marriage counseling, not banana splits.
0,0,0,Evolution did you say?
0,0,0,What makes you think you have a split personality?
0,0,0,What makes you think he just wanted you for your body?
0,0,0,So what time of the day do you find yourself more appealing?
0,0,0,Do you think being called a fruit is an insult?
0,0,0,...and then she just split on me.
0,0,0,Guilty? Of course I feel guilty -- I made a Freudian slip!
0,0,0,Inanimate objects like me should be respected like all other people!
0,0,0,It's not uncommon to feel empty on the inside.
0,0,0,I've never felt more fruitless.
0,0,0,So why do you think others find you so unappealing?
0,0,0,So where did we leave off? Oh, yes. You feel empty and ripe for change.
0,0,0,You've got to stop letting people walk all over you.
0,0,0,Well, it was a very difficult split
0,0,0,Your suggestive remarks are not appealing to me!
0,0,0,So you’ve lost touch with your inner self, you’re a danger to others --and you think you’re still appealing?
0,0,0,How did you slip back in here?
0,0,0,You seem to delight in bringing others down.
0,0,0,In analysis, it's what you hear, not what you see.
0,0,0,I'm sensing an unusual amount of friction from you today.
0,0,0,So you don’t feel appealing?
0,0,0,Bringing others down will never fill your emptiness.
0,0,0,Are you trying to provoke me into a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Doctor, I think I'm slipping.
0,0,0,so how do YOU feel about being stepped on all the time?
0,0,0,An orange referred you to me?
0,0,0,'Appeal' is all I have left
0,0,0,You need to stop dating all these low hanging fruit.
0,0,0,Let's return to the monkey business that we were exploring in our last session.
0,0,0,You're feelings of worthlessness seem to be well founded.
0,0,0,You have expressed how you love her a bunch...
0,0,0,I'm sorry I can't submit to your foot fetish.
0,0,0,When did you first become aware you had lost Chicqita?
0,0,0,You need to accept some responsibility for how others react to you.
0,0,0,Surnames are not destiny, Mr. Peel.
0,0,0,Do you ever feel that life has peeled away what dignity you had left?
0,0,0,Say more about losing your sense of purpose.
0,0,0,So you and your wife split....
0,0,0,Great legs- guys fall for me too but don't marry
0,0,0,I know finding out you are actually a berry and do not grow on a tree is traumatic but...
0,0,0,I thought you found me appealing.
0,0,0,Psychiatrist: "How do you peel?" Banana Peel: "I'm slipping at life."
0,0,0,How did causing that slip make you feel?
0,0,0,Of course you're not bananas!
0,0,0,well what do you mean by a peeling ?
0,0,0,So how long have you thought you were a banana?
0,0,0,It was just a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I just don't get no respect!
0,0,0,No, Mr. Denham, I will not call you 'Kong,' and please come down from the bookcase.
0,0,0,How many slip-ups is this?
0,0,0,So, when did start believing you were President?
0,0,0,I think it's a little too late for Viagra.
0,0,0,How long have you felt you are a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Textbook split personality.
0,0,0,So people walk all over you, and others laugh about it?
0,0,0,Lots of empty nesters feel kind of aimless.
0,0,0,If you could be a person, who would you be?
0,0,0,I know it's painful, but it's funnier with you.
0,0,0,Green, yellow, brown-- now black—can’t seem to fit in.
0,0,0,We try not to use the word 'bananas'
0,0,0,No, Mr. Peel, I do not want to slip on something more comfortable.
0,0,0,Being degradable doesn't give people the right to degrade you.
0,0,0,Let the tomato laugh. He's stuck at first base.
0,0,0,I promise you I will not be shocked at what we may find as we peel away your facade.
0,0,0,You must have felt very exposed.
0,0,0,You're overthinking things - it was just a minor slip-up.
0,0,0,When I accepted the role I thought “Planet of the Apes” could make me famous…
0,0,0,You feel guilty because of a "Freudian Slip"
0,0,0,Stop blaming yourself. It was just a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Nobody anywhere, ever, takes you seriously?
0,0,0,When did you first realize that you identified more with satire?
0,0,0,And how does it feel to be the instrument of everyone's jokes?
0,0,0,Despite your loss, let's not minimize your worth as an excellent source of dietary fiber and potassium.
0,0,0,That's a slippery slope you're going down.
0,0,0,Everyone tries to walk all over me
0,0,0,Don't you ever get tired of people stepping on you?
0,0,0,It's time we talked about finding a new purpose.
0,0,0,You can't keep putting yourself in those situations.
0,0,0,No, I am not going to do that with my legs.
0,0,0,Have you ever had this feeling of complete emptiness before?
0,0,0,Tell me more about how you caused your father's demise.
0,0,0,Do you think it's in your nature to bring people down?
0,0,0,No, I keep telling you, that was not a Freudian slip. Maybe it's time you looked for another analyst.
0,0,0,You say someone stepped on you and slipped?
0,0,0,What's eating you is up inside?
0,0,0,How are you feeling about the split now?
0,0,0,I'm not sure I really understand what's eating at you.
0,0,0,So it was only after the split that you began feeling empty inside and noticed your work was slipping?
0,0,0,And then I slipped up and called her by her mother's name.
0,0,0,So, you've never been the same since she left, Mr. Miranda?
0,0,0,And why do you think you feel empty inside?
0,0,0,so you think that you have lost your appeal..?
0,0,0,Why do you think you have a "slippery" feeling?
0,0,0,And why do you feel unappealing?
0,0,0,Sometimes splits can be messy.
0,0,0,And when Freud stepped on you, how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,I have this obsession about causing Freudian slips
0,0,0,My life's been an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,So this emptiness you've been feeling....
0,0,0,Banana splits are junk food, but being a smoothie would be heroic.
0,0,0,So, how long have I been having this delusion?
0,0,0,tell me...were you rejected when you were a seed
0,0,0,The Fall of Man is hardly a laughing matter, Mr. Peel.
0,0,0,How long has The Name Game been your favorite song?
0,0,0,It just just took a shrink to minimize the fruit of my existence
0,0,0,Why do you think you caused the accident?
0,0,0,Your gender re-assignment procedure appears to have been a complete success.
0,0,0,Because you've been peeled and your innards used for a smoothie, it would be prudent to increase your Prozac dosage significantly for the foreseeable future.
0,0,0,So I'm hearing that you feel empty and think you may be headed for a slip.
0,0,0,'You're just not appealing.'
0,0,0,Doctor, there's something that's been eating away at me.
0,0,0,And why exactly do you feel so broken?
0,0,0,Today we're going to talk about why you think you're a joke to everyone.
0,0,0,You have to stop blaming yourself, he's the one who slipped!
0,0,0,'A classic case of banana envy.'
0,0,0,And how did this tremendous fear of monkeys begin?
0,0,0,And then I realized, I AM the slippery slope.
0,0,0,I tend to lead to people's downfall.
0,0,0,Lately I've just been feeling empty inside...
0,0,0,Yes, I gave you the AARP discount.
0,0,0,I always feel rejected
0,0,0,How do you feel, now that you've opened up so much?
0,0,0,How often do you feel like this?
0,0,0,It's OK. Not everything you do needs to knock people off their feet.
0,0,0,You always feel stepped on?
0,0,0,So, how did you decide on yellow?
0,0,0,You feel as though you're split in half, with a vast, creamy coldness separating you from yourself.
0,0,0,Let's get to the bottom of your split.
0,0,0,Naturally, you're moving from separation anxiety to grieving a central loss.
0,0,0,I feel unloved. Nobody slips on me anymore.
0,0,0,I'm tired of people walking all over me.
0,0,0,Don't be delusional. Of course you are a peeling.
0,0,0,"It wasn't your fault. He was probably distracted and slipped. I see this a lot".
0,0,0,The correct expression is sex appeal. And no, I wouldn't care to.
0,0,0,So...your job at Banana Republic wasn't what you expected?
0,0,0,This last split has been really hard on me.
0,0,0,That's okay, I'm not a Freudian.
0,0,0,I just want someone who won't walk all over me.
0,0,0,What do you mean, you've been looking at my slip?
0,0,0,People step all over me and then pretend like they're the victim.
0,0,0,And you think you wanted him to fall?
0,0,0,Have you ever considered the possibility that they are not laughing at you?
0,0,0,I really feel like I've been slipping lately
0,0,0,I've never felt tallied.
0,0,0,What made you guys spilt up?
0,0,0,Did the other splits cause this much anxiety ?
0,0,0,Was it Freudian?
0,0,0,You use this word "split", can you expand on that?
0,0,0,Technically speaking, it's dissociative personality disorder. But in your case, we'll just go with split personality.
0,0,0,My previous client wanted to apologize for the fruit bowl mix-up.
0,0,0,How about selling slippers as a career change for yourself?
0,0,0,What else do you feel besides emptiness?
0,0,0,Therapy just never seemed appealing
0,0,0,So tell me exactly why the term 'second banana' is such a problem for you.
0,0,0,It's pretty clear that no longer being top banana is eating you up inside.
0,0,0,I was just one from a giant bunch. Fighting my way through this cruel world with ambitions to be the Big Banana.
0,0,0,And it's never your fault?
0,0,0,A dream about being stepped on doesn’t mean you are having feelings of being inferior.
0,0,0,I think you need some time to peel.
0,0,0,I guess it all started when I saw my mother in a slip.
0,0,0,Monsieur Banana, please tell me your improved Potassium concentration since our last psychiatric session?
0,0,0,I'm feeling so empty inside. It's just bananas.
0,0,0,Now I just feel so empty. It's a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Tell me more about your Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I really think we are making progress in peeling back your emotional layers.
0,0,0,I'm sorry Mr. Cavendish, but would you be more comfortable with a less a-peeling therapist?...
0,0,0,Something's eating you up inside.
0,0,0,I'm going to suggest a good compost pile.
0,0,0,Mommy always told me I had great appeal, but I'm not so sure.
0,0,0,I'm afraid low humor doesn't enhance appeal.
0,0,0,I suppose that was a breach of the physician-patient relationship.
0,0,0,When did you first have this feeling that you're on a slippery slope?
0,0,0,Funny, yet dangerous. Maybe I have a split personality.
0,0,0,Vikram Yoga may be able to help you with life/work balance.
0,0,0,You call that trauma?
0,0,0,Let's not go there, in your case, Oedipus complexes is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I'm a bit concerned my patient finds me too a-peeling
0,0,0,You're making progress but your slipping a little
0,0,0,Let's try and peel back an earlier incident when you were tossed aside.
0,0,0,Sometimes I feel people only care about what's on the inside.
0,0,0,Just be glad I'm not a cigar.
0,0,0,So how long do you think your friends have been finding you unappealing?
0,0,0,The key is to not slip back into old habits.
0,0,0,So, if I'm understanding you correctly, you're worried that corporate might be looking to replace you because your current comedic skill-set has become outmoded?
0,0,0,So, how did you discover that it's "appeal" and not "a peel"?
0,0,0,This isn't right, but I think I'm falling for you.
0,0,0,Who knew "going bananas" was a real thing?
0,0,0,So when did you go bananas?
0,0,0,I agree. You're an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,I have a Ph.d. in psychology, abnormal psychology, and a frequent shopper's card at the Fruit Emporium.
0,0,0,But let's get to the root of this
0,0,0,So you feel guilty about all these slip-ups?
0,0,0,It's no longer called a split personality.
0,0,0,You are experiencing a kind of penis envy...
0,0,0,When did you feel you were not part of the bunch.
0,0,0,Can you really blame yourself for her texting while walking?
0,0,0,Why do you feel it was Freudian?
0,0,0,We all slip up sometimes. Forgive yourself and move on.
0,0,0,I'm just a shell of my former self.
0,0,0,Hurting someone isn't going to help you feel whole.
0,0,0,I'm sorry Mr. Hide, but you did not invent the Freudian slip.
0,0,0,No, it's perfectly natural to feel there's something missing in your life.
0,0,0,Of course you have appeal.
0,0,0,You should know by now life is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,You have made such great progress unpeeling all those layers!
0,0,0,You still blame yourself for the split?
0,0,0,Tell me about your lunch date.
0,0,0,What makes you think people are laughing at you?
0,0,0,Last session you said you felt like you were going bananas with energy, and now you feel you are slipping into an internal emptiness?
0,0,0,When did you start feeling unappealing?
0,0,0,I understand that it's eating you up inside. I'm just asking how you feel about that.
0,0,0,The world's changing….I think I'm the one that's slipping!
0,0,0,Come again - you think the hands at the other end of the hoe might have been your mothers?
0,0,0,I prefer my fruitcakes without banannas.
0,0,0,Your not the only one. Oranges, Grapefruit and Avocados go through the same thing.
0,0,0,So what I hear you saying is, now that we have peeled back the layers, you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,Now let's discuss your fear of primates...
0,0,0,Going bananas's worse than bonkers
0,0,0,You're going to have to start taking yourself seriously first.
0,0,0,So, your family tree has bunches of siblings, and they were all close ... How sweet.
0,0,0,Blender-phobia is my specialty.
0,0,0,You say you are unappealing. When do you first remember having these feelings?
0,0,0,Now we need closure.
0,0,0,It's just a Freudian slip; let's move on.
0,0,0,You use humor to deflect the pain of your inner emptiness.
0,0,0,Don't feel so guilty. Tell them it was just a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Seems like you're ripe for a change.
0,0,0,Let's start with your early pollination.
0,0,0,I'm sorry if my lunch ate into your time.
0,0,0,You suffer from a split personality.
0,0,0,I think you may have experienced a sizable loss during the phallic stage...
0,0,0,How's it been since the split?
0,0,0,You say no one thinks you are appealing?
0,0,0,So, besides all the Chiquita stuff, what else makes you afraid of refrigerators?
0,0,0,I just have this feeling of emptiness
0,0,0,I can help you out . Which way did you come in?
0,0,0,When did you first experience agoraphobia?
0,0,0,Now that we switched places, do you have anything to say?
0,0,0,2 masters degrees and a phd and this is where is gets me, taking to a bunch of bananas
0,0,0,No I don't think you're too skinny.
0,0,0,You seem to have a twisted sense related to your sex appeal!
0,0,0,Confessions of an Ex-Vegan
0,0,0,I just want to feel respected. People walk all over me like I'm not even there!
0,0,0,I've been specializing in bananas for years. But, you are the first suicidal banana I've met.
0,0,0,If only I'd been born a toupee.
0,0,0,I think you may have a split personality.
0,0,0,I want to change my life, but I just can't see the appeal
0,0,0,I split up with my wife and she got her half of me from the divorce.
0,0,0,So tell me, when did you first notice you had this so called slip and fall complex?
0,0,0,Try to think of all those jokes you've appeared in as a form of popularity...
0,0,0,Sometimes I feel like I'm slipping from reality.
0,0,0,I feel people are trying to avoid me.
0,0,0,No I won't get back over there and finish my lunch, I am a real therapist, I am a real therapist
0,0,0,I'm sorry but I never date a patient.
0,0,0,So, you're feeling empty?
0,0,0,But when you let them walk all over you, they're the ones that get hurt.
0,0,0,So what's so funny about my slip?
0,0,0,We can't all be universally appealing.
0,0,0,From what you've told me in our sessions, you may suffer from split personality disorder.
0,0,0,I'm not surprised that you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,Why do they call me a slippery character?
0,0,0,Should I man up and just split?
0,0,0,Our time is up and please don't wait for me on the stairs.
0,0,0,Interesting. I said 'smoothly,' but you heard 'smoothie.'
0,0,0,Try to think of yourself as a peeling.
0,0,0,My feelings were hurt when the whole bunch said I wasn't appealing.
0,0,0,How exactly do you feel used?
0,0,0,It seems you don't have much to say about your split.
0,0,0,What happened after he fell down?
0,0,0,When did you first feel like you were slipping?
0,0,0,Sorry, that was a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,You're claiming that you're responsible for the Freudian slip?!
0,0,0,We call that a Freudian Slip, Mike.
0,0,0,Is it appropriate to pursue my dreams?
0,0,0,What makes you think you were rejected?
0,0,0,We no longer use the term "gone bananas" anymore
0,0,0,Well, Marvin. Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,Sometimes a doctor falls for the patient, but you aren't appealing to me.
0,0,0,It's a common problem for bananas your age.
0,0,0,It must have been a terrible blow to your self-image as "the yellow stalker" when friends called it corny.
0,0,0,So, how's your transgender transformation going?
0,0,0,I feel like I get blamed for every fall, Doc.
0,0,0,Why do You think you always hurt the ones around you?
0,0,0,I'm sorry I misdiagnosed you as nuts.
0,0,0,Stop calling me Chiquita!
0,0,0,Now we need to focus on building you back up.
0,0,0,Somedays I feel like an accident just waiting to happen.
0,0,0,Ok, go ahead and tell me about your latest slip-up.
0,0,0,I've been stepped on my whole life.
0,0,0,I just feel like I'm always getting stepped on being the butt of everyone's jokes you know.
0,0,0,Let's set some ground rules right now -I will not tolerate slippery behavior.
0,0,0,So, you said. "You have one foot in the grave, and the other one is a banana peel".
0,0,0,Shall we start with the splits--I mean slips--you mentioned?
0,0,0,It's not your fault that everybody slips up when you are with them....you need to get over it ....and move on.
0,0,0,Is being organic really that important to your self esteem?
0,0,0,This is good, this is very good, you're starting to open up now.
0,0,0,No, I'm not wearing a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,When did you start to think you were slipping?
0,0,0,You show classic symptoms of an Edible Complex.
0,0,0,Tell me more about the tally man.
0,0,0,So you feel like your life is slipping away?
0,0,0,So tell me more about this 'first banana'...
0,0,0,After twenty five years of marriage we split. Just like that. Can you believe it doc? Now my life is so empty. I just can't seem to hold it together.
0,0,0,I want you to understand that everything said here will be held in strict confidence.
0,0,0,Oh no, I tried to draw a gorilla... But it ran
0,0,0,So you feel that people are avoiding you.
0,0,0,Even though your inner core is missing, you still have appeal.
0,0,0,so, he only wanted you for your potassium?
0,0,0,What makes you feel like you've been torn apart?
0,0,0,We've all had a few slip-ups!
0,0,0,And yet people continue to walk all over you.
0,0,0,That's a bit of a role reversal, usually you cause people to slip up
0,0,0,Look I don't say this to patients often, but you really are bananas.
0,0,0,First they smile and tease me about being appealing. Then the eat me!
0,0,0,I just feel like everybody keeps stepping on me.
0,0,0,Let's explore why your mother found you unappealing.
0,0,0,Let's explore you're feeling 'Appeal' Diminished
0,0,0,No, I believe you. You don't need to show it to me.
0,0,0,Tell me a little more about this "empty inside" feeling.
0,0,0,So what I hear you saying, is that you feel on a personal and professional level you're slipping.
0,0,0,You didn't lay on the sidewalk on your own, did you?
0,0,0,When did you first feel this desire to take people down
0,0,0,You need to take these sessions more seriously.
0,0,0,For the hundredth time, it's not YOU they're laughing at!
0,0,0,I feel guilty about all the slip and falls that I've caused.
0,0,0,I told her of course I'm happy to see you. And then she slapped me.
0,0,0,"I've been feeling better about the split, but I can't get over the fact that she just took everything and tossed me out the window like a banana peel".
0,0,0,When did you first notice your split persona?
0,0,0,I feel that your sanity is beginning to slip.
0,0,0,Again, Mr. Walters, in my profession we don't like to use that word.
0,0,0,Exactly when did you feel your relationship start to slip?
0,0,0,It's just transference. I'm not falling for you.
0,0,0,the problem is your appeal
0,0,0,Its a slippery slope, Doc
0,0,0,Don't slip on your way out.
0,0,0,With the loss you suffered ... it's only natural to feel inadequate.
0,0,0,Let us talk about that Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Hmmm... It's clear you have a split personality.
0,0,0,WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU COULD BE PRESIDENT
0,0,0,It sounds as if your self-loathing is really driven by your jealousy of the Blue Shell.
0,0,0,That's what we call in the profession a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Tell me about your loss of inner self.
0,0,0,I've been empty inside ever since the split.
0,0,0,I find you strangely appealing...
0,0,0,Yes, I am wearing a slip!
0,0,0,And what did Mr. Freud say after you made him slip?
0,0,0,Let's talk about your recurring sense of emptiness.
0,0,0,This is the third slip this month.
0,0,0,Something inside of me is missing.
0,0,0,"Everyone slips.
0,0,0,He just made like a banana and split.
0,0,0,You,ve been outsourced. I can't make you great again.
0,0,0,I was born a berry but transitioning as a fruit
0,0,0,Can you tell me exactly what you mean by "appealing?"
0,0,0,Do you resent being the butt of cartoon jokes?
0,0,0,When did you get the feeling that you are no longer appealing?
0,0,0,Sorry, but unless you fully accept me when I open up we can not have a fruitful conversation.
0,0,0,Talk more about your feelings of being used and discarded.
0,0,0,We all feel empty from time to time!
0,0,0,I am telling you Doc, you are going to have to peel me off this couch.
0,0,0,Try to work on pulling yourself together.
0,0,0,Everybody feels like garbage sometimes.
0,0,0,When did you start feeling this emptiness inside?
0,0,0,Why do you think people walk all over you?
0,0,0,You're saying the machete was a real thing?
0,0,0,So...you say you have a history of making people fall down but you're upset when people think that's funny.
0,0,0,Do you find yourself slipping?
0,0,0,I feel there's something left hanging.
0,0,0,Yes, you have no banana!
0,0,0,It's been a slippery slope. They keep falling head over heels for me.
0,0,0,So, the end of vaudeville made you feel low...
0,0,0,When did you first start having nightmares of gorillas?
0,0,0,I'm in a funk. Sure I've got a tough exterior, but I'm completely empty inside.
0,0,0,We all have slips.
0,0,0,Look, I admit you have appeal, but sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,So you think you finally got that monkey off your back?
0,0,0,Obviously, your fruit was not comfortable in its own skin.
0,0,0,Why do you always think it's your fault?
0,0,0,So, you have this recurring dream.! You think people are avoiding you.
0,0,0,And why do you think that was a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Slip? No that's Freudian. I'm a Jungian.
0,0,0,Well, she said she was really into good carbs...
0,0,0,The correct pronunciation is still "flak´sid," but do go on.
0,0,0,O. M. G! Now I need therapy–and a huge fruit salad...
0,0,0,Let's start with your tallyman
0,0,0,So you feel like you're always being stepped on...
0,0,0,No more jokes about making a Freudian slip, OK?
0,0,0,Tell me how you peel
0,0,0,You need to stop letting people step all over you.
0,0,0,... but the important thing is that YOU know sometimes a banana is just a banana
0,0,0,How long have you been feeling rotten?
0,0,0,Actually 'sex appeal' doesn't mean that.
0,0,0,50 years since “Mellow Yellow”... . forget about being a sudden craze
0,0,0,It could be postpartum depression, but tell me more about the split.
0,0,0,I can't. I see your appeal, but you're a patient....
0,0,0,Literal or Freudian?
0,0,0,sounds like you have a banana split personality disorder
0,0,0,On impulse, I agreed to a split, and now I'm desolate.
0,0,0,So how did it feel when you were kicked out of "The Wild Bunch?
0,0,0,So he decided to split with you on Sunday over another banana?
0,0,0,And how did it make you feel. . . being tossed out on the sidewalk?
0,0,0,It seems like your relationships fail because you split.
0,0,0,Don't worry, we all have that moment when we're a greasy banana peel.
0,0,0,In these dreams then, the monkey figure represents the manifestation of your worst fears.
0,0,0,No, your unconscious is not like an onion. It's more like...a banana.
0,0,0,Perhaps they're laughing with you?
0,0,0,No, that's not all the skin you have in this game.
0,0,0,No more weddings.
0,0,0,I feel like the entire world is just stepping all over me
0,0,0,Why do you keep dating monkeys if you feel they always take more than they give?
0,0,0,And I told her, 'You know, sometimes a banana is just a banana.'
0,0,0,None of my patients have peeled back the layers quite like you
0,0,0,In my opinion, you're not nuts.
0,0,0,Well I suppose I first started acting out when my father split
0,0,0,Would you say that you're still suffering feelings of abandonment?
0,0,0,I get it now. It wasn't the split. You feel that you've been stepped on all your life.
0,0,0,So, you're tired of being constantly cast aside.
0,0,0,What happened to the balls you had when you began your analysis?
0,0,0,Although I was born a squid I always felt I wanted to live my life as a calamari.
0,0,0,Let's talk about the 800 pound gorilla that used to be in the room.
0,0,0,Sometimes it's not what's inside that counts.
0,0,0,So just where do you get this sudden compulsion to peel?
0,0,0,Eaten and thrown away. I'm sure you know what it's like Doc.
0,0,0,Well yes...it is ironic that my slip is also showing...
0,0,0,Looking inward is the way to deal with these feelings of emptiness.
0,0,0,Some women think that I am quite appealing!
0,0,0,Yes now that you have opened up I understand the appeal that separates you from the bunch, but I can't slip from my professional oath.
0,0,0,No, they don't have a name yet for fear of causing others to fall.
0,0,0,Yes, Yes, I am sure you were once quite the specimen but lets explore those feelings of inadequacy.
0,0,0,I guess I just don't understand why I always have to be the fall guy.
0,0,0,Yes, let's go back this "hopelessly empty" feeling you've described having since the judge denied your re-peel.
0,0,0,Are you planning a freudian slip?
0,0,0,Classic banana-split-personality disorder.
0,0,0,Can you tell me where the monkey touched you?
0,0,0,But how do you feel when people walk on you?
0,0,0,How does your job affect your self-esteem or your sense of guilt?
0,0,0,Of course there's more to you than just physical humor.
0,0,0,Do women actually fall for that?
0,0,0,My partner walks all over me.
0,0,0,You don't say
0,0,0,So you blame yourself for that man's slip-and-fall?
0,0,0,Tell me about the urge to call a woman "chiquita".
0,0,0,Tell me more about your Mama.
0,0,0,I don't think you will ever find your inner self.
0,0,0,Then they accused me of making a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,You feel that people only see you as a joke?
0,0,0,To ease your depression you have to keep reminding yourself that you are the top.
0,0,0,And then she added sprinkles..
0,0,0,It hurts. All I ever hear is 'It's what's on the inside that counts'.
0,0,0,>> And how does that make you peel--I mean, feel? >>*Sigh*...Like I'm going bananas.
0,0,0,I'm better with the layers of an onion.
0,0,0,I took your advice and opened up to people, but ended up getting stepped on.
0,0,0,I'm tired of getting slipped on all the time
0,0,0,So...you identify more as an apple, but still prefer bananas. I have that right?
0,0,0,And how did it make you feel, being the youngest of six?
0,0,0,Your case is appealing to me.
0,0,0,In order to fully communicate what we feel inside we must peel away at the guard we have been holding up to truly convey our emotions.
0,0,0,How long have you thought that you are a banana peel?
0,0,0,Does it bother you that people think you're bananas?
0,0,0,Tell me again about your day at the zoo, especially the part about the monkey house.
0,0,0,I just haven't been the same since the split.
0,0,0,Subject complains of not peeling well and trouble with slipping.
0,0,0,I don't know... people just walk all over me and I find myself slipping into depression.
0,0,0,How did you feel about the peeling?
0,0,0,I suggest a cat…monkeys are trouble.
0,0,0,This is not about my shoes.
0,0,0,''When things go bananas, make banana bread.''
0,0,0,A Banana is a Banana....How many times do I have to say this?
0,0,0,What makes you feel that you are the butt end of a joke?
0,0,0,My expierence with Banana's like yourself, is that there's more than meets the eye,
0,0,0,What I am hearing, is what was on the inside is no longer appealing.
0,0,0,What did you do with the chimp?
0,0,0,We ARE making progress, but remember, sometimes a banana really is just a banana.
0,0,0,When did you first notice you'd lost touch with your inner self?
0,0,0,You know, these feelings of neglect are quite normal at your age.
0,0,0,Don't internalize blame -- it is his own fault he slipped on you. On behalf of: Howard F. Taylor, Princeton, N. J.
0,0,0,You *have* to get over these feelings of inferiority.
0,0,0,When did you first feel that you were coming "unpeeled"?
0,0,0,I'm hearing that it was really hard for you when your dad split.
0,0,0,So you blame a few aging spots on your skin for this sense of emptiness...
0,0,0,And then, what did Josephine Baker say?
0,0,0,Didn't I slip on you last week?
0,0,0,Okay, so we can begin with your mother abandoning you.
0,0,0,Frankly, I find you less than appealing.
0,0,0,So tell me, why do you think everyone considers you a joke?
0,0,0,Perhaps they were laughing with (italics) you, and not at (italics) you.
0,0,0,I feel like the whole world is falling down around me.
0,0,0,Slippery is one thing, but now you're being evasive.
0,0,0,I often feel like the punch line to a joke.
0,0,0,Everything points to a split personality.
0,0,0,You seem devoid of substance lately.
0,0,0,The appeal will be classified under "separation anxiety."
0,0,0,I just feel so hollow inside.
0,0,0,How long has it been since your partner split?
0,0,0,Sometimes I just feel like such a joke.
0,0,0,I'd rather you sit. I'm a Freudian and I would hate to slip.
0,0,0,Hmmmm. Uh-huh. That's a potentially good insight, Mr. Dreckenburg, but would you consider the possibility that your Freudian slip might merit a more psychological interpretation?
0,0,0,And you're convinced that if people don't avoid you then something terrible could happen?
0,0,0,What makes you say that you aren't getting any traction in your relationships?
0,0,0,I hear your arguments , but you must decide . No more split decisions.
0,0,0,Even though you say you feel empty inside, she cannot deny you're a peel.
0,0,0,You're unpeeling me with your eyes.
0,0,0,In order to peel away the layers of your problems I'd suggest group...I mean bunch...therapy.
0,0,0,My divorce? What can I say? She peeled off and gave me the slip.
0,0,0,Your problems stem from the fact that you have no a-peel .
0,0,0,Why do you think you feel empty inside?
0,0,0,Everything was great in Costa Rica. Now I'm feeling somewhat discarded.
0,0,0,So what is worse, when people step on you, or avoid you all together?
0,0,0,...and you say I'm appealing?
0,0,0,Let's talk about these so-called Freudian slips.
0,0,0,Why do you think lack appeal?
0,0,0,Thank you; I find you appealing too.
0,0,0,When did this feeling of emptiness inside begin?
0,0,0,Let's keep this professional. You're in no way appealing to me.
0,0,0,You're turning black. Our session time is up.
0,0,0,So size is the big issue.
0,0,0,That was around the time we split up
0,0,0,Well yes, technically that WOULD be a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I just can't shake this schadenfreude...
0,0,0,Are you insecure about always being the "fall guy"?
0,0,0,I also didn't think the New Yorker could come up with another cartoon about psychotherapy.
0,0,0,I assure you it's off the record; you can slip away at any time.
0,0,0,You need to stop seeing other people's missteps as your own.
0,0,0,Did you know your farmer?
0,0,0,"A 'slippery slope'? Tell me more about that feeling".
0,0,0,I think you really do feel guilty of the fall that happened.
0,0,0,My whole life is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Sometimes you work so hard to peel away a patient's exterior persona and there's just bupkis underneath it all.
0,0,0,...and then he said I was smothering him with all my peelings
0,0,0,Please stay on the couch so you don't make a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Daylight came and he wanna go home.
0,0,0,Are we ready to talk about the split?
0,0,0,Things were terrific until I got fired during his quest to appear more presidential.
0,0,0,Making people slip on the sidewalk still makes you an important contributing member of society.
0,0,0,Yes, you are quite appealing. But therapist/client relationships are always a slippery slope.
0,0,0,What were you expecting, a National Day of Morning?
0,0,0,We have to end there. I have a desert island coming in at 3:00.
0,0,0,So, why do you find it distasteful when she calls you her top banana?
0,0,0,So.. have you always felt this "need" to make people slip and fall?
0,0,0,You don't think you're funny anymore? We call that "Gallagher Syndrome.
0,0,0,You have plenty of skin in the game. You just need the guts to see it through.
0,0,0,I don't think being transgender is going to matter with regard to fitting in.
0,0,0,It’s just an ugly stereotype doc. I mean how would you feel “Look out it’s a banana peel”, or “Don’t get near the banana peel”, “Oh, here comes the big scary banana peel!"... Nice legs by the way.
0,0,0,``Let me stop you right there. In case you haven't notice, I'm a banana, not an onion. So let's not go the `layer' route, OK?''
0,0,0,I feel used and abused.
0,0,0,You shouldn't blame yourself for all the slip ups.
0,0,0,I used to be the top banana in New Jersey
0,0,0,I keep getting blamed for slip and falls.
0,0,0,Such are the dreams of the everyday housewife.
0,0,0,They hate it when I point out their Freudian slips.
0,0,0,Well, my father was from a strict organic family, while my mother was a plantain. So I guess I'm a banana split.
0,0,0,How long have you believed that deep down inside you were actually a starfish?
0,0,0,I'm afraid that you're an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,For me, it was love; but he only wanted my flesh.
0,0,0,Why do you think you're empty inside?
0,0,0,i think we are heading down a slippery slope
0,0,0,So when she left she took the best part of you?
0,0,0,Yes, you're spineless, Deirdre, but that doesn't mean you lack the courage to look deep inside yourself.
0,0,0,.......and when she split, did she also take the cherry?
0,0,0,You have very similar features to a vase I'm treating for anxiety.
0,0,0,Every day I wake up, I feel like an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,I don't care what you and your bunch think. I find the label Chiquita offensive.
0,0,0,It’s not important that I’m appealing.
0,0,0,And how did Freud slipping on you make you peel?
0,0,0,Everyone who comes here thinks they're bananas.
0,0,0,You've been committed because you could cause harm to others, not because you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,We need to work on that obsession--and no, I'm not wearing one.
0,0,0,I slipped when I said that.
0,0,0,I'm feeling a little empty.
0,0,0,That's your third slip this session!
0,0,0,Why do you doubt your appeal?
0,0,0,The term ‘going bananas’ seems an especially harsh self-criticism. How can we rephrase that in a way that expresses less judgment?
0,0,0,Try to remember: they're not laughing at you, they're laughing with you.
0,0,0,And why exactly do you feel no one finds you "a-peel-ing"?
0,0,0,Have you always been thin-skinned?
0,0,0,I don't find my life as appealing as it once was.
0,0,0,So tell me how does that make your Republic feel?
0,0,0,Unfortunately, our time is up for today-O. Your fears of tally-man will have to wait.
0,0,0,He really is going bananas.
0,0,0,How did it make you feel when he left you for the Genetically Modified Organism?
0,0,0,And why do you describe yourself as an 'accident waiting to happen'?
0,0,0,How long have you had a split personality?
0,0,0,Our split was the best thing for us.
0,0,0,Forget guilt about them falling. Why do you keep getting stepped on?
0,0,0,After which you suffer from uncontrollable hysterics?
0,0,0,It's not your fault the guy slipped.
0,0,0,We need to move beyond these Freudian slips.
0,0,0,Some people say I have appeal, but I feel so empty.
0,0,0,You're so passive-aggressive.
0,0,0,A priest, a rabbi. . . Then stage fright. It was a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Are you familiar with the term "castration anxiety?"
0,0,0,I know I said it's a slippery slope but I didn't mean it literally
0,0,0,It's not a trust issue, I always sit like this.
0,0,0,When did you start feeling as though people were always stepping on you?
0,0,0,Yeah, I get it, don't get them in a bunch?
0,0,0,Of course you feel abandoned...
0,0,0,You think you're crazy? I'm talking to a banana.
0,0,0,Your responses are all quite slippery.
0,0,0,Causing pratfalls is an attempt to compensate for your impotence.
0,0,0,Why blame yourself if it was only a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,I'm sorry but 'Going Bananas' is not a billable diagnosis.
0,0,0,And what makes you think you have a banana split personality?’
0,0,0,So, h
0,0,0,And why do you say that you think you lack substance?
0,0,0,She split!
0,0,0,I'm going to slip on something more comfortable.
0,0,0,You said yourself that monkey was just using you.
0,0,0,You have to stop allowing that type of comedy define you
0,0,0,Suddenly I feel more appealing.
0,0,0,"You have an unhealthy obsession with the concept of a 'split personality'".
0,0,0,Look, I understand that you're feeling empty inside. But it's no reason to let your life slip away.
0,0,0,When did your father split from the bunch and how did that make you peel?
0,0,0,So, you're making an appeal to lessen the number of New Yorker psychiatrist cartoons?
0,0,0,You're ripe for a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Well, if your partner lacks appeal, perhaps you should just split.
0,0,0,I guess it all started back in vaudeville.
0,0,0,So to summarize, you feel discarded ?
0,0,0,Slips happen
0,0,0,Why do you feel your life is slipping away?
0,0,0,You need to find a thick-skinned role model.
0,0,0,Normally I like to explore your inner child, but in your case I can see that will be a problem.
0,0,0,Life has been so empty without Josephine around to liven things up!
0,0,0,I see you've gone bananas but we need to talk!
0,0,0,I keep having this reoccurring dream that I am trying to hurt someone.
0,0,0,We all slip. It's getting back up that takes courage.
0,0,0,After years of anguish from witnessing his family being made into a fruit salad, Jeff the Banana seeks psychological help.
0,0,0,You are an accident waiting to happen!
0,0,0,Orthopedic surgeons love you .
0,0,0,You do understand you're only proverbial, right?
0,0,0,It's like he only cared about what was on the inside...
0,0,0,This Rx should help that split personality
0,0,0,Mr. Dole? What happened? Did you take the blue pill an hour before your date with Chiquita like we discussed?
0,0,0,I feel like I've lost the best part of me
0,0,0,You don't seem happy to see me.
0,0,0,She gave me the slip, peeled off, and left me nothing but a husk.
0,0,0,So you feel like you're heading down a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I feel so empty and rejected and just want to get back to my bunch.
0,0,0,You have to acknowledge why you feel so hollow inside
0,0,0,A Freudian slip, no doubt.
0,0,0,Don't be so hard on yourself, you're all appeal.
0,0,0,So I hear you saying that you feel you pose a substantial threat of physical harm to others.
0,0,0,You feel the hilarity of someone slipping on you doesn’t compensate you for the pain of being stepped on? I’m sorry – I treat standup comedians on Thursdays only.

0,0,0,It happened again. He said he was just happy to see her.
0,0,0,What did you expect? You were smothering her.
0,0,0,Tell me, did you always find it amusing when you felt yourself starting to slip?
0,0,0,Therapist: "Split up!" Patient: "But I love my apple!"
0,0,0,Low potassium? Oh, please...........
0,0,0,When did you first start having these feelings of rejection?
0,0,0,Please tell me more about that dream. So you were a stepping stone and then...?
0,0,0,You dreamt you slipped on a high heel...?
0,0,0,Now that you've peeled off your soft and mushy side, let's see if we can work on your dark spots
0,0,0,You say you're losing appeal?
0,0,0,You've been causing a lot of Freudian slips.
0,0,0,I was once the top banana, then I split.
0,0,0,I'm just tired of people stepping all over me!
0,0,0,I'm hearing that your trouble comes in bunches.
0,0,0,It's not your fault that they don't watch where they're walking.
0,0,0,I can assure you that I will not fall for you!!!
0,0,0,It takes time to recover from any life-changing episode, and it must be so painful that your banana split.
0,0,0,I feel like something is missing from this relationship.
0,0,0,Well, I'm flattered, but I think we need to keep our relationship purely slapstick.
0,0,0,You seem split about your relationship.
0,0,0,You can't keep blaming yourself for other people's slip-ups.
0,0,0,...and how long have you felt this sense of emptiness, this loss of purpose?
0,0,0,So, are you single?
0,0,0,Since Chiquita left me I feel empty inside
0,0,0,Divorce? More like they got...split.
0,0,0,Well, it didn't take too long for you turn bad.
0,0,0,I told you that I like to smell the flowers.
0,0,0,When people sing "Day-o" at you, initiate your calming strategy.
0,0,0,It's nice to see you really open up.
0,0,0,Why do you feel you are ripe for a change?
0,0,0,We agree your life in slapstick is over. I think you should go into composting next.
0,0,0,I said "How did that make you feel, not how did that make you peel."
0,0,0,I had no choice, you were going bad!
0,0,0,Let's unpeel that.
0,0,0,First, let's lose that negative self-image, OK? Your appeal is that you're a peel.
0,0,0,Sometimes you just have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start 'em fallin' all over again.
0,0,0,Very sneaky...you almost got your therapist to slip and tell you what I'm thinking
0,0,0,Tell me again about that dream where a clown steps on you.
0,0,0,Now, today, where do we start: your feeling that you're squeezed out, unnoticed or simply rotten?
0,0,0,You sure are a mouthful.
0,0,0,Let me guess. You feel empty.
0,0,0,Tell me why you feel so empty.
0,0,0,But I don't think you could be more appealing than you are right now.
0,0,0,Finally we are ripe for discussion
0,0,0,This is called "survivor's guilt". You could not have prevented that slip and fall accident.
0,0,0,Try thinking of all the mirth you bring to others.
0,0,0,It all started when i was born an open banana.
0,0,0,So, tell me, what makes you feel used an tossed aside ?
0,0,0,I understand you were involved in a sidewalk tragedy?
0,0,0,In your case, I'd have to say the emptiness you feel inside is justified.
0,0,0,So how do you peel?
0,0,0,I sense you feel fruitless and unappealing.
0,0,0,Say more about this feeling of emptiness you have.
0,0,0,Tell me about your first split.
0,0,0,The pratfalls don't get laughs anymore, just compassion and Day-o, Day-o, Day-o.
0,0,0,I'm not even a Freudian, so stop worrying about slips.
0,0,0,So you're saying you feel as if your whole life has been a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I feel like everyone avoids me
0,0,0,I used to be green with envy. Now look at me.
0,0,0,Why should I feel guilty for her fall? She shouldn't have been wearing those silly backless Why should I feel guilty for her fall? She shouldn't have been wearing those silly little backless shoes!
0,0,0,Sounds like empty-peel syndrome.
0,0,0,And tell me why you don't feel appealing anymore?
0,0,0,Let's see if we can get deeper than the feeling that you're "slip, sliding away."
0,0,0,I know it's unethical, but I just love the way you feel inside of me.
0,0,0,Maybe you'd be more comfortable on the floor.
0,0,0,So, your wife really said, 'I slipped up when I married you!'?
0,0,0,I get the feeling everyone's trying to avoid me.
0,0,0,I feel like a part of me is missing.
0,0,0,I'm sorry for your loss.
0,0,0,I'm tired of being blamed for other people's slip-ups.
0,0,0,You silly doofus, the fruit flies really ARE after you.
0,0,0,I'm referring you to another therapist who does not have food issues.
0,0,0,I understand you work for Slip and Fall insurance company
0,0,0,Sorry, Freudian split. I meant to say feel.
0,0,0,To be clear...when you refer to "the slip" are we talking bedroom or sidewalk?
0,0,0,Try to adapt to the Big Apple.
0,0,0,So when did you start feeling responsible for Freudian slips?
0,0,0,I know, its been like three decades since the Knicks' last championship.
0,0,0,Technically you have one foot on a naugahyde.
0,0,0,So how did it make you feel when the person slipped and fell
0,0,0,I'm always typecast as the slippery guy
0,0,0,No, I don't think Viagra will help you.
0,0,0,Just because you made that guy slip doesn't make you any less appealing. They were laughing with you, not at you.
0,0,0,Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,So -- deep feelings of emptiness followed by bouts of hysteria?
0,0,0,Are we Mr. Plantain or Mr. Banana today?
0,0,0,Your friendship with the monkey was bound to end in betrayal and a profound sense of loss.
0,0,0,Enough with the "me, me, me", everyone slips at one time or other!
0,0,0,He's a chutzparrot.
0,0,0,You've had a Freudian slip -Evan Kowal, South Pasadena, CA (Age 14)
0,0,0,It's what's inside of you that matters.
0,0,0,I've really slipped up in life.
0,0,0,So, you enjoy making slip-ups?
0,0,0,Your survivor's guilt over the fate of your 'better half' is unhealthy.
0,0,0,I'll work with you on that trait of being slippery..
0,0,0,What about transitioning straight to mulch?
0,0,0,Well what if the stability you provide is to audiences rather than pedestrians?
0,0,0,I've been slipping up at work a bunch lately. I'm worried I'm losing my appeal.
0,0,0,You splay, I cross, that's why it's not gonna happen.
0,0,0,Lately I feel as though my life's path is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Have you ever heard of a Freudian slip-and-fall?
0,0,0,Your fear of being 'tossed aside' is not an irrational one.
0,0,0,I can't believe I slipped up like that.
0,0,0,But I find you very appealing...
0,0,0,I can certainly see you're a peel.
0,0,0,....so how did you feel after she slipped and hurt herself ?
0,0,0,When did you first start feeling that people are laughing at you?
0,0,0,Can you tell me why you split up?
0,0,0,Banana: "Why don't you pull your skirt up also?"
0,0,0,I thought you said you were "appeallng," not "a-peeling".
0,0,0,So, you think you're no longer a peeling.
0,0,0,So my Freudened Jung lady, do I not have a peel?
0,0,0,Why do you feel you're just a shell of your former self
0,0,0,Of course you feel like one more slip and it's all over.
0,0,0,Another Freudian slip on a banana peel!
0,0,0,I'm looking for a therapist with real appeal.
0,0,0,Then he just pealed me open, it was awful it still haunts me now...
0,0,0,You let people walk over you once and it's a slippery slope!
0,0,0,I can only help with the Freudian slips.
0,0,0,14 grams of sugar, you had no choice.
0,0,0,No, I don't know how many Freudians it take to slip on a banana peel!
0,0,0,No, that was the other kind of slip.
0,0,0,So, you and Cherry decided to make the split?
0,0,0,I see you're getting aroused. Is it this discussion about your days on the stalk - or are is it my short skirt?
0,0,0,So you're feeling somewhere above dog poo but still below a puddle?
0,0,0,And why is that a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,And I really resent when she accuses me of slipping up.
0,0,0,So all of your relationships end up hitting rock bottom?
0,0,0,The split has been so hard on the kids that they're considering a foster home.
0,0,0,Stop blaming yourself. It's not your fault people step on you.
0,0,0,You are one banana, not bananas.
0,0,0,Your prognosis is appealing.
0,0,0,Talk to me about your split.
0,0,0,Every time I slip, my friends say: "Heh! Freud."
0,0,0,I just don't find myself appealing anymore.
0,0,0,Apparently neither of them is properly licensed.
0,0,0,Ok Bo, it's your money, but I have to remind you that this is not the name game.
0,0,0,Dear, I'm afraid our son is into extreme sports.
0,0,0,I was nuts. Now I seem to be full-on bananas.
0,0,0,So, you just feel slippery all over?
0,0,0,I think you just made a banana slip.
0,0,0,I don't find behavioral therapy to be very appealing.
0,0,0,That is not what is meant by the term Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I think you'd be happier with a Freudian analyst.
0,0,0,So slapstick comedy felt patronizing?
0,0,0,While I do find you appealing, you should know I don't date my patients.
0,0,0,And yet you seek Jungian therapy?
0,0,0,So, if I may summarize: many find you to be a-peeling, yet treat you like garbage. Do I have that right?
0,0,0,Would you prefer I address you as Mr. Foster or "Bananas"?
0,0,0,Would describe your emotional state as peeled right now?
0,0,0,At times we all feel stripped, empty, and that we cause others to slip up...
0,0,0,No, Mr. Maharishi Yogi, get back here. That's not a banana split!
0,0,0,Do you thikn you're a banana peel?
0,0,0,I guess Freud was right...
0,0,0,You're right, you are unappealing.
0,0,0,And how does being the brunt of so many jokes make you feel?
0,0,0,Sorry I can't see you anymore- I'm now limiting my practice to vegetables
0,0,0,Now, I know that you and your ex split...
0,0,0,So, when did you start to think people were laughing at you?
0,0,0,This is your third session with me and you still haven't said a word. I know what happened to you was difficult, but they put that gorilla in a zoo. He can't hurt you anymore. It's time to heal.
0,0,0,Of course you are appealing...
0,0,0,Tell me more about this eviseration.
0,0,0,Explain to me again why you feel your life is so fruitless.
0,0,0,So what, you made a guy slip. You gonna stop living?
0,0,0,More than has been the case with my other patients, a Freudian slip from you is understandable.
0,0,0,So, how are you coping with the split?
0,0,0,"You should feel much better about yourself, you have great appeal".
0,0,0,And when did you leave the bunch?
0,0,0,Are you telling me about a blonde joke?
0,0,0,Have you considered you might not be as funny as you used to be?
0,0,0,I'm determined to surface the hidden cause of your feelings of emptiness and abandonment.
0,0,0,When I suggested we dig beneath the outer shell to reach your inner core that did not mean you leave the rest of you including your wallet at home.
0,0,0,I wouldn't take it personally. Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,It might have been juvenile, but I was making people laugh. Now, I am a bad retired joke.
0,0,0,What makes you think I find you a peeling?
0,0,0,Have you considered resting in places where people *won't* slip on you?
0,0,0,Could it be that you're still grieving after the split?
0,0,0,I just don't peel very good.
0,0,0,Why do you think you enjoy making people slip up?
0,0,0,I am sorry Mr. Banana, but you are too soft. I like my fruit firm. Now lets continue our session.
0,0,0,So, she finally split on you? Tell me...how did that make you peel?"
0,0,0,So, your loss of self-confidence was triggered by diminished firmness or fear of being peeled in public?
0,0,0,They used to rave about my potassium and fiber, and now it's just slurs about my glycemic index.
0,0,0,So your partner split. How did that make you peel?
0,0,0,You say she offered to make you a daiquiri?
0,0,0,So, you feel empty, walked on and as if everyone is laughing at you?
0,0,0,How can you say, "It's like peeling an onion?"
0,0,0,And why exactly do you feel that you're unappealing?
0,0,0,No, I wouldn't diagnose you as nuts just a little fruity.
0,0,0,I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life !
0,0,0,Don't look at your Psychiatrist like this. I will sue you for sexual harassment.
0,0,0,Tell me how you really peel
0,0,0,If you're looking for a Freudian Slip here you can forget it...
0,0,0,So you only feel like half an octopus.
0,0,0,What can I say, sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,Whenever I feel pressure, I slip things up.
0,0,0,When was it you first realised you no longer had any more skin in the game ?
0,0,0,Being top banana wasn't quite what I expected
0,0,0,You're low sense of self-esteem stems from the fact that you really are garbage.
0,0,0,Do you think I have a split personality?
0,0,0,You are depressed that people eat apples with the skin but not bananas?
0,0,0,Why do you think people step all over you?
0,0,0,Quit monkeying with me.
0,0,0,Oh, it slipped your mind, did it?
0,0,0,You feel you're appealing but have a sense of inner loss.
0,0,0,That's a pretty slippery slope you're on, Mister!
0,0,0,So when did you first notice this feeling of emptiness?
0,0,0,Yes just a cigar, just a banana, and just a banana peel.
0,0,0,I disagree. Not everything's a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I see. How does that make you peel?
0,0,0,I am afraid this discussion is just fruitless.
0,0,0,They call me heartless—but sometimes I just want a good trip, you know?
0,0,0,How long has it been since the banana split?
0,0,0,Our time's up. Please see yourself ALL THE WAY out
0,0,0,So tell me... How did you get from being in the compost to being one of the biggest GMO tycoons in the nation?
0,0,0,So I take it that with your addiction you've had another slip.
0,0,0,Aha, when did you start feeling "empty?"
0,0,0,When did you first feel the onset of this split personality disorder?
0,0,0,I think what you're saying is, now that you've been eaten, your options are limited.
0,0,0,Uh-huh, and when did you feel you were slipping?
0,0,0,I am appealing to you, fix me, I feel empty inside.
0,0,0,Don't you think your mother could have fallen because of a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,This type of behavior will eventually leave others hurt.
0,0,0,When they slip think of it as laughing with you and not at you.
0,0,0,Im not gonna let this one slip away...he is quite appealing
0,0,0,I think you can make me , Doc.
0,0,0,Everyone tells me I still have appeal, but I just feel empty inside.
0,0,0,Sometimes a banana is just a banana. Sometimes, it's what you feel missing inside.
0,0,0,I feel your pain. I know Beyonce is no Carmen Miranda.
0,0,0,You know, Doctor, I don't think switching chairs is helping.
0,0,0,I can't understand why she didn't find you appealing.
0,0,0,When did you first feel you'd become cliché?
0,0,0,I'm glad you're being so open with me.
0,0,0,lets start back at this "pre-lunchbox" period then, as youve coined it.
0,0,0,Sure I am soft hearted but why do they blame me for giving them the slip?
0,0,0,Really? You named your daughter Emma?
0,0,0,You must feel very empty inside.
0,0,0,I suggest that at our next session you try not to get so excited.
0,0,0,I mean I'm falling apart but, mostly, I feel just empty.
0,0,0,So why did you 'lifestyle path' choose to start on this type of slippery slope?
0,0,0,No need to feel embarrassed...the whole world has gone bananas.
0,0,0,Besides feeling empty , what else is troubling you?
0,0,0,What do you mean they don't find you appealing?
0,0,0,Perhaps injuring people is beyond your control.
0,0,0,I understand that this situation isn't very appealing, but you need to take your mental health seriously.
0,0,0,It doesn't matter if you're not mentioned first, you're still an integral part of the sandwich.
0,0,0,It's a lot of pressure, you know, to be the son of the guy who caused the Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I know you are jealous, but you have a leg up in other ways
0,0,0,I identify myself as a peach, so I should be allowed to use the peach bathroom.
0,0,0,Sometimes a slip is just a slip.
0,0,0,because it's funny when they trip and fall ?
0,0,0,Keep taking the medicine. I'll give you another prescription for the side effects.
0,0,0,But it doesn't have to be funny . . .
0,0,0,Was that uncomfortable for you?
0,0,0,No offense, I am thick skinned
0,0,0,This could be a slippery slope to your old ways.
0,0,0,No, I don't think all those slips were Freudian.
0,0,0,Your progress has been undermined by an oral fixation.
0,0,0,When did your fear of monkeys begin?
0,0,0,You need to get over being upset being a slapstick joke.
0,0,0,You are, most certainly, an early bloomer.
0,0,0,And what makes you think that people find you dangerous?
0,0,0,And when did you start feeling like an objective correlative?
0,0,0,Can you tell me when these feelings of emptiness began?
0,0,0,So. You overheard this person say she felt as worthless as a banana peel after the banana's been eaten. How did this make you feel?
0,0,0,You say you're insecure but I find you to be very appealing.
0,0,0,What happens when people do walk all over you?
0,0,0,Why do you feel that he won't fall for you?
0,0,0,How do you feel about vanilla ice cream, crushed nuts and whipped cream?
0,0,0,I keep thinking I'm a potato.
0,0,0,Hollywood's hard on starlets and starfish—and you're both.
0,0,0,Do you think your identification as a cheap comic device could be a source of your self-worth issues?
0,0,0,So you offered Chiquita protection, and she threw it all away?
0,0,0,Why do you think you're drawn to slippery slopes?
0,0,0,We should have known that you taking a job at an ice cream parlour would lead to separation anxiety.
0,0,0,Once and for all, it's never coming back.
0,0,0,Ever since I opened up to my girlfriend, I've had this very empty feeling inside.
0,0,0,What makes you think a split _has_ a personality?
0,0,0,So, you feel like an empty shell at times?
0,0,0,You're projecting again . . . you are not the butt of ALL jokes.
0,0,0,And why do you feel guilty?
0,0,0,It's a classic case of a split personality.
0,0,0,How about we get in touch with your inner fruit?
0,0,0,Ignore that, please. It was a slip, that's all.
0,0,0,I don't know. I guess when it came down to it I never thought we'd ACTUALLY split.
0,0,0,You can't blame your parents for being a GMO.
0,0,0,How long have you felt like you're 'missing something'?
0,0,0,Well, for Freud wasn't always right, but "banana envy" gives us a starting place to examine the psychological effects of living in a society which exploits and devalues banana peels.
0,0,0,Well you are society's garbage. Get over it!
0,0,0,Let's not compare apples to oranges, ok?
0,0,0,Maybe you don't have an inferiority complex. Maybe you really are an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,It seems you have peeled back your surface persona. Perhaps now we can get to the real issues.
0,0,0,So you feel everyone steps on you
0,0,0,Im still uncomfortable getting naked
0,0,0,When did you first start feeling people were giving you the slip ?
0,0,0,You have lots of appeal. How long have you had this narcissistic thoughts?
0,0,0,Tell me about your nana, Nana Beau Bana.
0,0,0,So you've lost your banana. You're still appealing.
0,0,0,Is your need to make people slip and break their necks a subliminal desire to get back at your mother? I don’t know – you tell me.
0,0,0,At least you still have your peelings.
0,0,0,So was it a tough split?
0,0,0,I don't know if she slipped away because I'm empty or if I'm empty because she slipped away.
0,0,0,I don't even sleep with green bananas.
0,0,0,It does appear that your last campaign took a lot out of you, Mr. Dole.
0,0,0,So, when did you begin to regret making people slip and break their necks?
0,0,0,People say I bring them down
0,0,0,When did you start to feel different? When did you start to feel different?
0,0,0,What did you do to prepare yourself for the inevitable split.
0,0,0,Going bananas doesn’t necessarily mean you’re nuts.
0,0,0,Why do you think you're so prone to Freudian Slips?
0,0,0,My humming "Yes, We Have No Bananas" doesn't mean I have countertransference issues!
0,0,0,I'm sorry, but you sound like a nut.
0,0,0,Maybe look at this way, the thing about being a peal is that you are still a survivor.
0,0,0,You may think I have great legs, but you have no appeal for me.
0,0,0,But it's not your fault that they keep slipping!
0,0,0,As a Freudian, I’m intrigued, but as a feminist, you disgust me.
0,0,0,I dunno doc, it just feels like the whole world is slipping away from me.
0,0,0,Tell me about your childhood. How many siblings were in your cluster?
0,0,0,All right now. I think we've had quite enough monkey business!
0,0,0,When did you begin feeling empty inside?
0,0,0,Have you considered all the possible causes of your situation?
0,0,0,Please don't take this personally but I'm not sure if I'm qualified to help you!
0,0,0,I see that you grabbed hold of that potassium-deficiency suggestion from our last session.
0,0,0,"You feel people don't find you appealing?
0,0,0,There are a bunch of problems I want to talk about.
0,0,0,You appear to be suffering from an Edible Complex.
0,0,0,It is not at all unnatural to encounter feelings of emptiness given your recent circumstances
0,0,0,Tell me more about your fear of losing grip on reality...
0,0,0,OK, can I now speak to Mr. Apple?
0,0,0,You suffer from a banana split personality
0,0,0,You're right; some of us bruise easier than others.
0,0,0,So what I'm hearing you say is that you feel empty, small and unappealing?
0,0,0,Orange you glad you split?
0,0,0,It was a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,So you say you felt hollow, empty, like a shell of what you once were...
0,0,0,What is this obsession with monkeys?
0,0,0,I just really feel like I'm not myself anymore, like my inner self has been ripped out of me.
0,0,0,Tell me about that void you feel inside.
0,0,0,Why do you feel like the world is waiting for you to slip up?
0,0,0,What do you feel when you hear "banana split"?
0,0,0,So you have feelings of emptiness, like something is eating at you from the inside...
0,0,0,Tell me about your peeler.
0,0,0,Could there be any way you're contributing to how all these relationships end?
0,0,0,I don't think this is a good time to step it up
0,0,0,This is not what I meant when I said you should re-evaluate your core beliefs.
0,0,0,Tell me again, Peel, how you felt parting with your banana and watching it be eaten right in front of you as you were tossed to rot. Quickly though, you don't have much time before you decompose.
0,0,0,It's separation anxiety. But you still have appeal.
0,0,0,ah Banana Ana Fo Fana, 'tis time for your fee fi fo fana
0,0,0,Your feelings of emptiness are quite palpable.
0,0,0,Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
0,0,0,But when they say they slipped on you, maybe it's just a metaphor.
0,0,0,Yes but let's focus on your appeal.
0,0,0,I understand that not *every* slip is a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I'm tired of being the fall guy.
0,0,0,When did you first feel the urge to lie down on pedestrian crossings?
0,0,0,When do you feel your life became a joke?
0,0,0,You can't blame yourself. Accidents happen.
0,0,0,I guess you are just a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,To be honest, a part of me wants them to slip...
0,0,0,Easy to get a complex when you are just apealing .
0,0,0,Do others find you appealing?
0,0,0,Transference is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,How do you mean, "empty"?
0,0,0,Sometimes you peel open, other times you just split.
0,0,0,My couch is not 'clothing optional'!
0,0,0,I see this could lead to a Freudian Slip
0,0,0,Analysis is all about peeling back the layers.
0,0,0,So your Mom said you need a job with more prestige?
0,0,0,You're missing the part of you that's been consumed. We call it an edible complex.
0,0,0,You need to understand your appeal.
0,0,0,Penis envy should (underlined or italicizes) be expected at your stage of development.
0,0,0,I am a Jungian, why do you ask?
0,0,0,So, your mother was your first victim?
0,0,0,I can see you're empty on the inside, but to move forward we need to find the core issue here.
0,0,0,And why do you think you have trouble seeing my beard and cigar?
0,0,0,I remember when I slipped into you.
0,0,0,Your transference, not mine.
0,0,0,Your parents were in a split when you were younger?
0,0,0,Is that a poison banana skin?
0,0,0,Thick skinned?
0,0,0,Your not a fruit! Explain?
0,0,0,After all these sessions, I was hoping that we could finally go a little deeper than "I come from a strange bunch."
0,0,0,So now you're a Banana Democrat?
0,0,0,Can you tell me more about this reoccuring dream you have about being stepped on?
0,0,0,I agree. It's definitely hate speech to use the term "Going bananas".
0,0,0,So, how did that make you peel...I mean feel?
0,0,0,How long have you felt you've lost your true inner essence?
0,0,0,Emotionally, you are just an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,Define your definition of a slip-up.
0,0,0,Yes, I can see how you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,So I understand you are "Chiquita" but now want to be "United Fruit" ?
0,0,0,No, no Mr Houdini, I meant peel of your outer clothing only.
0,0,0,I'm just a joke.
0,0,0,So, were you ever abused as a seed?
0,0,0,I don't know, Bob. It could be a slippery slope.
0,0,0,When you chose a career in show business, do you feel you were just reinforcing your need to be stepped on?
0,0,0,Keeping a straight face with this client proved challenging. Whenever he expressed longing for a life partner, Dr. Jane couldn't help recalling that 'pair of slippers' punchline.
0,0,0,Depression, heart palpitations, fatigue. You could be low in potassium.
0,0,0,Seeing as I ate you for lunch, I'll comp this session.
0,0,0,How do you get out of the way in time?
0,0,0,Mr Peele, it appears you have a severe case of Flooraphobia
0,0,0,Clearly, you're suffering from a split personality.
0,0,0,Yes, Mr. B., a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Where did you learn that I specialized in fruit psychology?
0,0,0,You're not ready to start dating again. In my view, in your current state you're just an accident waiting to happen!
0,0,0,Is this because I said you're bananas?
0,0,0,Goodness, I never thought that couch had appeal until now.
0,0,0,I'm going to have to ask you to zip yourself up.
0,0,0,So you were deserted for ice cream, syrup, and whipped cream. You still have appeal.
0,0,0,It's not only what's inside that matters.
0,0,0,I'm not judging you... a fruit is a fruit.
0,0,0,When someone steps on me, I make them slip and fall as revenge." "Sir, I think you've gone bananas.
0,0,0,It's like no one ever sees me.
0,0,0,Tell me more about your life on the street.
0,0,0,You ARE empty inside.
0,0,0,A Jungian?" No wonder you don't see the problem!
0,0,0,Was your hand raised happily?
0,0,0,You say Tony Soprano recommended that you come here?
0,0,0,People may toss you away but always remember it's what's inside that counts.
0,0,0,Don't blame yourself for other people's slip-ups.
0,0,0,Alright Howard, same time next week?
0,0,0,Yes, anyone can blame you, but why do you accept that blame?
0,0,0,So how did that little Freudian slip make you feel?
0,0,0,I just feel that my wife wants to throw me in the trash.
0,0,0,You're starting down a slippery slope...
0,0,0,Tell me how you're peeling
0,0,0,I'm telling you doc, I just feel empty on the inside.
0,0,0,We've covered the emptiness -- let's talk about your mother.
0,0,0,Frankly, you don't even look bruised.
0,0,0,So, nobody has ever slipped on you and this has disturbed your id?
0,0,0,The fact is, you're slippery. They were laughing with you, not at you.
0,0,0,Yes, I find you appealing. Is that wrong?
0,0,0,Well it's not unethical to eat your client if your hungry and it's a fruit.
0,0,0,I heard you've got a monkey on your back
0,0,0,Of course it hurts when you open up fully and then just get tossed aside.
0,0,0,From another perspective, your comedy brings a lot of joy to people.
0,0,0,I just... don't find life a-peeling anymore.
0,0,0,And how would you say you're handling the split?
0,0,0,You need not doubt yourself. Of courseyou have appeal.
0,0,0,I believe that comment was a banana slip.
0,0,0," So you say she quit seeing you after she ate you"?
0,0,0,And, you know, it's a slippery slope from there.
0,0,0,What evidence do you have that you're no longer appealing?
0,0,0,Then she said "Orange you glad I said Banana"...
0,0,0,It is a slippery slope dreaming that you are the banana that everyone slips on.
0,0,0,It's not always your fault.
0,0,0,So, what makes you think I would fall for you?
0,0,0,Body language 101: Legs crossed AWAY is a sure sign of low a-peel.
0,0,0,For a phallic symbol, you're a disgrace.
0,0,0,...as if the joke's always on you.
0,0,0,Let's slowly peel back your emotions.
0,0,0,Every time I get my life together, I cause someone else to slip.
0,0,0,You're no longer appealing to her.
0,0,0,And you're depressed because no one slipped on you?
0,0,0,Typecast or not- you must embrace playing the part of being slipped upon.
0,0,0,Since technically it was a patient that left you, I suppose I can bill you as a referral discount this one time
0,0,0,Of course, we all ask ourselves at one time, if a fruitless life is worth living.
0,0,0,But please, tell me why you want to be an eggplant.
0,0,0,People see you as a walking joke?
0,0,0,So you have a phobia about being stepped on for laughs?
0,0,0,You're only bananas when you're with the rest of your bunch.
0,0,0,My recurring nightmare is a 500 pound man in a hurry crossing my path.
0,0,0,It seems like a bad case of split personalities.
0,0,0,When did this fear of causing an accident start?
0,0,0,Let's revisit the recurring dream of Elvis slicing you and putting you on a peanut butter sandwich, How did that make you feel?
0,0,0,I do not find you appealing, Mr. Brinkwater.
0,0,0,So your saying it was a Freudian slip
0,0,0,I need your undivided attention.
0,0,0,Might it have been a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,I'm tired of being called the "fall guy".
0,0,0,I'm sorry, I charge by the hour, not the pound.
0,0,0,So,when did you start identifying as a plantain?
0,0,0,How do you feel about being DISCARDED
0,0,0,I understand that you feel fruitless, but you haven't lost your appeal.
0,0,0,I get the sense that people avoid me.
0,0,0,So you don't find yourself appealing anymore?
0,0,0,I actually do find you a-peeling!
0,0,0,Yeah, I was hanging in there for a while. Now... Not so much.
0,0,0,I swear if they are going to stick a "gluten free" sticker on me I will lose my mind.
0,0,0,Sadly, the couch holds little appeal for her these days.
0,0,0,Sometimes a banana is just a banana. Sometimes a banana is just a banana. Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,I know, it’s a such cliché, but I’ve fallen over you…
0,0,0,The desire for revenge is normal.
0,0,0,So you have come here because things have been slipping your mind lately, yes?
0,0,0,But not everyone can be top banana.
0,0,0,I can't help but feel I'm going to be the cause of someone's downfall.
0,0,0,That's quite a big Freudian slip you just made.....
0,0,0,I, too, fear the vegans.
0,0,0,When did you first realize you were only skin deep?
0,0,0,...and what is your earliest memory of being stepped on?
0,0,0,Sounds like it was more than a Fruedian slip.
0,0,0,No kidding! You're really going bananas?
0,0,0,"So you feel that this split can be contributed to your being cut down in your prime, your separation anxiety from the bunch you grew up with and the cause of a near fatal clown fall".
0,0,0,So, you've only recently begun to have feelings of gender confusion?
0,0,0,You knew going in a life in comedy wasn't easy.
0,0,0,I know — it's not funny when people avoid you.
0,0,0,Why do you think people find you slippery?
0,0,0,I'm going bananas. Everyones hurting my peelings now because I'm too sugary!
0,0,0,So whenever you try to talk to someone you keep slipping up?
0,0,0,You're the second banana split personality I've seen today.
0,0,0,When did you first start fearing monkeys?
0,0,0,I cannot in all honesty say you are appealing
0,0,0,How does that typically make you peel?
0,0,0,So, since when have you had this hollow feeling.
0,0,0,He'll never get better if he doesn't take his peels.
0,0,0,You've got to work on becoming more thick-skinned.
0,0,0,What would you say is missing?
0,0,0,So tell me, why did you split?
0,0,0,And how do you peel about that?
0,0,0,"I think we're getting to the core now"!
0,0,0,I'm leaning towards banana split personality, but there a bunch of other possibilities
0,0,0,No, you can't call me 'Jane!
0,0,0,I see. So it was a banana in your pocket.
0,0,0,Twenty brothers and sisters? Wow, that's a bunch!
0,0,0,I said you might have Multiple Personality Disorder. I never said you were bananas.
0,0,0,You've slipped a little since our last session.
0,0,0,I believe you are suffering from banana envy.
0,0,0,Sometimes I just feel I'm slipping.
0,0,0,What eats you?
0,0,0,I am having trouble slipping because I peel guilty...
0,0,0,Tell me again what's keeping you from taking the next step and sliding?
0,0,0,Tell me about why you feel abandoned.
0,0,0,... and in what way did you used to be funny?
0,0,0,"Sorry. He said 'CIGAR', not 'BANANA'.
0,0,0,Well, I can certainly see how you would feel that way. However, I don't feel your entire life is a joke.
0,0,0,Doc, I'm just sick of always getting stepped on.
0,0,0,Of course we're all stereotyped. Look how they drew my legs.
0,0,0,"Why do you think comedy has lost its appeal for you?
0,0,0,Nobody finds me appealing.
0,0,0,Let's talk about your family tree.
0,0,0,How do you feel, being an ecdysiast?
0,0,0,Yes, I told the orange I was glad he was not a banana, but I was just going along with the joke.
0,0,0,And in this recurring nightmare, are you always the cause of the accident?
0,0,0,Mr. Wentworth, you can come out now I ate the Banana monster.
0,0,0,I just don't understand your appeal.
0,0,0,You say you used to be hilarious; OK, let's work on that.
0,0,0,Maybe they're not laughing at you but with you.
0,0,0,Umm..I should have given him an extra two or three minutes when he told me he was going bananas.
0,0,0,I can see how that moment left you empty inside.
0,0,0,The 'bottom-opening hack' has upset a bunch. You're not alone.
0,0,0,You can't blame yourself for that accident.
0,0,0,No one falls for me anymore.
0,0,0,You weren't consciously uncoupled. You split.
0,0,0,Donald we all agreed that having a woman therapist would be part of your therapy. Now you run off leaving me only your banana peel.
0,0,0,I'm sorry, but could you please explain what a "hollaback girl" is again?
0,0,0,My husband is driving me bananas! I have tried everything to make him happy. I have even tried to make myself more a peeling.
0,0,0,Sorry. Mellow Yellow has been debunked.
0,0,0,So, you and your wife just split?
0,0,0,I seem to have lost my inner self.
0,0,0,Would you say you feel emtpy since we peeled away the surface?
0,0,0,Again with the guilt? He slipped. He fell. Get over it!
0,0,0,Keep telling yourself that your slippery reputation is greatly outweighed by your health benefits.
0,0,0,You're going to have learn to stop blaming yourself.
0,0,0,I'm afraid you're suffering from what we call a banana split personality.
0,0,0,"So, you'rean exposed fruit,so what"?
0,0,0,Not everyone can been the top banana.
0,0,0,Take me back to your parents' split.
0,0,0,So when did you start feeling like a mere shell of your former self?
0,0,0,So when did your partner split?
0,0,0,I WOULD NOT REFER TO THIS SESSION AS FRUITLESS
0,0,0,All the other banana peels get slipped on, but nobody wants to slip on me.
0,0,0,Well, why do you think everyone seems to avoid you?
0,0,0,Well, split personality is considered an outdated diagnosis.
0,0,0,What is a brown or black oxford?
0,0,0,Lets peel back the layers on your split personalities today
0,0,0,And when did your sex peel begin to slip?
0,0,0,Being the second banana is okay. As long as you're not the third.
0,0,0,I constantly feel scapegoated.
0,0,0,Let's go back to the first time someone slipped on you. How did that make you feel?
0,0,0,Let's talk about why you feel like a joke and why you seem to feel "stepped on."
0,0,0,I feel like I'm an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,So, my wife said she was leaving me because of my obsession with monkeys.
0,0,0,I just don't find life appealing.
0,0,0,Don't be hard on yourself - the guy who just left here was a real nut!
0,0,0,For how long have you felt that you are really a vegetable?
0,0,0,I guess in a smoothie it doesn't count as cannibalism.
0,0,0,Tell me: what's been eating away at you?
0,0,0,What do you mean, 'Sometimes a banana is just a banana.'?
0,0,0,Your feelings of emptiness are understandable, considering the slippery slope you've described.
0,0,0,No, no, I said that was a Freudian slip!
0,0,0,And what makes you think people avoid you?
0,0,0,Berry, I know you are misunderstood, but you have thick skin.
0,0,0,So you feel you were labeled?
0,0,0,Tell me more about these dreams....the ones with the "tally man."
0,0,0,Tell me about your relationship before the split.
0,0,0,I'm going to level with you, this seems like the product of a very slippery mind.
0,0,0,So in a way, these constants slips are self sabotage?
0,0,0,We all experience feelings of emptiness from time to time.
0,0,0,Give me a break Mr. Flower. I don't want to exaggerate my billing, so you'll just have to sit there for an hour.
0,0,0,You know, your appeal with me is slipping......
0,0,0,Well, I'm more than JUST glad to see you.
0,0,0,My professional opinion is that you're nuts. No, that's not the word I'm looking for...
0,0,0,So, I hear your life has been pretty slippery these days.
0,0,0,how long have you identified as a vegetable?
0,0,0,I am so sick of being called Chiquita!
0,0,0,Now really? A Freudian slip?
0,0,0,I actually think your fear of abandonment issues are well founded.
0,0,0,Yes, I do find you appealing.
0,0,0,I'm sorry, I didn't have breakfast.
0,0,0,So what exactly are we this week?
0,0,0,Tell me more about your complex of being the center of everybody's gags?
0,0,0,Calm down. Try to compost yourself.
0,0,0,I’m sorry but even without that part it's unethical for me to date a patient.
0,0,0,So how long have you been feeling empty inside?
0,0,0,I thought your appointment was on Wednesday.
0,0,0,I am sorry. I was hungry and I didn't realize you were the patient.
0,0,0,Are you feeling empty inside?
0,0,0,And for how long have you had this sense that you've lost your comic timing?
0,0,0,And what exactly makes you feel these slips are Freudian?
0,0,0,So, you're feeling incomplete ...
0,0,0,...And what made you think it was a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,I'm sorry to hear about the decline of your appearance in comedy acts, but you should know that political correctness is killing your genre.
0,0,0,If you want to have a successful relationship, you need to stop giving people the slip
0,0,0,I'm sure you do feel empty, but can you imagine how the monkey feels?
0,0,0,How did you feel after the split?
0,0,0,I would ask how things are going, but I see we are headed down a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I'm a Jungian - collective unconscious and all that. But I will grant you that sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,Tell me about life since the split.
0,0,0,The truth is, no one _really_ falls for your type.
0,0,0,Yes, Freud slipped here.
0,0,0,And what makes you think you've lost your appeal?
0,0,0,You aren't going to tell me that Freudian slip joke again, are you?
0,0,0,I just feel that life is slipping by me
0,0,0,You can't be discouraged because not everyone falls for you.
0,0,0,Tell me what happened after you peeled off from the bunch.
0,0,0,Besides the hygiene issues, my code of ethics prohibits a relationship.
0,0,0,You lack sex-a-what?
0,0,0,It's not what's on your outside that counts, it's what's on your—oh, right.
0,0,0,You're not top banana anymore and that's got you depressed.
0,0,0,Wow... so plantains really are bananas.
0,0,0,Yes, you have no banana. No banana today.
0,0,0,What kind of appeal?
0,0,0,When did you discover that your wife had an affair with a tomato?
0,0,0,Your libido is on fire?
0,0,0,Do you feel light headed?
0,0,0,What I'm hearing is that you're uncomfortable with maraschino cherries.
0,0,0,Stop staring at my legs, you filthy banananimal.
0,0,0,So you only feel fulfilled when someone steps on you?
0,0,0,It's hard for you to be taken seriously, as jokes referencing you are such low hanging fruit.
0,0,0,Excuse me, sir, but your session is not quite finished. Are you trying to give me the "slip?"
0,0,0,And you feel responsible for the split?
0,0,0,Try to be optimistic. Slapstick could always make a comeback.
0,0,0,So, how did your mother feel about your passion for tort reform?
0,0,0,...and then, I was skinned alive...
0,0,0,When you hear someone say "an apple a day keeps the doctor away," how does that make you feel?
0,0,0,You feel useless because someone hasn't tripped over you?
0,0,0,You seem confused why some people find you appealing and then just toss you away. When did these feelings first slip up on you?
0,0,0,You have got to stop blaming yourself for your wife's death.
0,0,0,I was just used and dumped. And it hurts.
0,0,0,So tell me, why do you feel so empty inside?
0,0,0,After losing the appeal, he declined to serve as first chair
0,0,0,I really don't think you need to doubt your appeal to anyone.
0,0,0,How has the metamorphosis affected your mood?
0,0,0,Diagnosis? Classic split personality.
0,0,0,Not even you my therapist finds me "apeeling".
0,0,0,Peeling away the layers will get you to the fruits of your labor.
0,0,0,I think I'm responsible for the Freudian Slip
0,0,0,I'm tired of everyone telling me I peel my clothes off like a banana!
0,0,0,Tell me more about this 'empty' feeling.
0,0,0,How did you really feel after she slipped?
0,0,0,Wanna' slip on something more appealing?
0,0,0,Let go of the guilt. They didn't watch where they were going.
0,0,0,You have to forgive yourself. Nobody could have seen that coming.
0,0,0,Lie back down on that couch or I end this session right now!
0,0,0,You seem consumed by your emptiness.
0,0,0,Your lucky, that was close!
0,0,0,How long would you say you've felt empty inside?
0,0,0,Tell me more about this split.
0,0,0,Chiquita and I split up again.
0,0,0,I feel so empty inside.
0,0,0,Well, you're not nuts, I can tell you that much.
0,0,0,I'm sick of being the fall guy.
0,0,0,I appreciate what you're saying. I just don't find you appealing.
0,0,0,It's a slippery slope when a patient tries to appeal to his therapist.
0,0,0,All said was, Your attraction to neanderthal types is perfectly natural.
0,0,0,Give up the guilt. It wasn't your fault.
0,0,0,And when did you two split?
0,0,0,I'm sorry for coming apart like this.
0,0,0,How does that make you peel—sorry, feel...feel?
0,0,0,Yes, I agree, some in therapy are more prone to slips of the tongue than others.
0,0,0,I'm afraid I need to peel myself away--our time has slipped.
0,0,0,What happened to your little pee pee?
0,0,0,Can you elaborate on what you mean by "I seem to have lost touch with my inner self".
0,0,0,nd how long have you felt like an accident waiting to happen?
0,0,0,When did you first start to feel empty inside?
0,0,0,Lately, I feel so empty.
0,0,0,So tell me again how you gave him the slip.
0,0,0,Mr. Petersen, you're not bananas, you just think you are.
0,0,0,Your father's tulip shade? Your mother's favorite flower?? Your life devoured from the inside out???
0,0,0,You need to let go of Curious George and get on with your life.
0,0,0,You can't appeal to everyone.
0,0,0,Tell me why the banana split.
0,0,0,The biodegradation...people avoid me on the sidewalk...I feel so empty.
0,0,0,I'm just afraid that no one will ever fall for me.
0,0,0,Do you think that was a freudian slip?
0,0,0,First thing that comes to you when I say "Split".
0,0,0,I just can;t deal with the guilt anymore.
0,0,0,So what's been eating you lately?
0,0,0,How long have you felt like you're out of touch?
0,0,0,Now i'm thinking the split was a good thing...
0,0,0,I've been thinking, Doc. Maybe sometimes a banana peel really is just a banana peel.
0,0,0,So, you think your skin is unappealing?
0,0,0,We can't move on until you can come to terms with your slippery side.
0,0,0,Oh, you poor thing!
0,0,0,How long have you had this feeling that you're just an empty suit...?
0,0,0,It was a joke. Slippery slope? I really think you should reconsider joining our compost support group.
0,0,0,So, tell me, exactly when did the frozen smoothie nightmares begin?
0,0,0,Have you ever lost anything that meant a lot to you?
0,0,0,He always said I'm nothing without him...
0,0,0,So you hurt people, but you don't mean to?
0,0,0,I'm tired of people just walking all over me.
0,0,0,I forgot to mention the side effects .
0,0,0,'So, you've just split with your better half'.
0,0,0,Look, I'm sorry, but I just don't find you appealing.
0,0,0,What do you mean by, "profound emptiness"?
0,0,0,When did you decide to change careers from health foods to comedy?
0,0,0,I never really wanted to be Bananas Foster.
0,0,0,Okay, so no one's ever slipped on you, get over it!
0,0,0,I just can't hide my true self anymore" "You're completely right, Mr. Trump
0,0,0,How long have you had nightmares about flying monkeys?
0,0,0,Everyone is waiting for me to slip up.
0,0,0,So tell me, how long have you felt that you're not a peeling?
0,0,0,Guess he ran out of cereal again
0,0,0," I'm glad you lost the core. This is the new post Freudian counseling.
0,0,0,Tell me more about why you think life is fruitless.
0,0,0,Can you say more about why you feel discarded?
0,0,0,'Me thinned skin, I doubt it. You're the one on the couch."
0,0,0,But I don't mean to cause people to slip, I just can't help myself.
0,0,0,Why, what does a banana symbolize to you?
0,0,0,What exactly do you mean by "empty inside"?
0,0,0,Mr. Peal, I'm afraid you are an empty husk.
0,0,0,Now let's discuss why you let people walk all over you.
0,0,0,I need you to open up more.
0,0,0,So, how did it make you feel when she slipped?
0,0,0,Did you consider the possibility that it's not you people are laughing at when you get stepped on?
0,0,0,Feeling fruity? Ah ha, ha ha ha. Damn, I meant bananas. Freudian slip? I'm so tired
0,0,0,So you find yourself unappealing?
0,0,0,And how does it feel to no longer be a phallic symbol?
0,0,0,So, tell me about those peelings of inadequacy again...
0,0,0,Why do you feel the need to compare yourself to apples and oranges?
0,0,0,Blaming someone else for your own emptiness is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,So, you never got over the split?
0,0,0,I think we have achieved a breakthrough. You finally realize your life has not been fruitless.
0,0,0,What if you can't find your birth tree?
0,0,0,Tell me more about these dreams you have been having about oblong objects.
0,0,0,Ever since I was a child I wanted to be more than something to slip on.
0,0,0,Has the fact that you didn't get a blue sticker been eating at you ?
0,0,0,So what exactly is it about exhibitionism that you find so appealing?
0,0,0,How are things since the split?
0,0,0,Why do you refuse to be labeled?
0,0,0,Can you repeat that? It must have slipped my mind
0,0,0,So, why do you think that you don't have appeal?
0,0,0,Hey, where did your other half go?
0,0,0,I come from a blended family.
0,0,0,Don't be embarassed-it's important to open up.
0,0,0,So you think your life is on the skids, do you?
0,0,0,I know it's a slippery slope but you must talk about it to get your footing.
0,0,0,You can't go on like this. You're an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,It's good to see that you are finally opening up.
0,0,0,I'm hearing that those you love are all slipping away from you.
0,0,0,Where are you going to come up with a hundred and seventy-five dollars an hour?
0,0,0,So you feel empty, rejected and slippery
0,0,0,Do you think all women find you appealing?
0,0,0,Can you tell me about the guilt?
0,0,0,Sorry, but any further innuendo and we'll have to end the session.
0,0,0,You've repressed your unconscious,Chiquita, to the brink of psychic annihilation.
0,0,0,If you don't mind, reality therapy might be more appropriate than Freudian analysis.
0,0,0,You are aware that upskirting is illegal in New York?
0,0,0,How long have you had this feelings of rejection?
0,0,0,Believe me when I tell you, you're just plain nuts.
0,0,0,We've got to deal with your feelings of bitterness next time.
0,0,0,Surely you have something left to give.
0,0,0,Don't even think of coming at me with your sex appeal
0,0,0,Why do you let people to step all over you for laughs?
0,0,0,Sometimes it feels like my life is just an endless series of slip-ups
0,0,0,But I do think you are being a little to hard on yourself. After all, there are really a lot of reasons why he might have fallen off the bridge.
0,0,0,You have a classic case of Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Sometimes a penis is just a penis.
0,0,0,And just what makes you think you're not appealing?
0,0,0,A steady gig with the National Chiropractic Association is nothing to feel guilty about.
0,0,0,Thanks for finally opening up.
0,0,0,Relax, Mr. Banana. Once more, what was it like before you lost your pulp?
0,0,0,You know that taking a walk is not an option.
0,0,0,Do you feel that others blame you for their mistakes?
0,0,0,Let's start with your abandonment issues
0,0,0,So, you feel like your life is slipping away from you?
0,0,0,One Freudian slip, and they're going to blame it on you.
0,0,0,Again, I apologize... But surely can understand why someone might titter when you say you have a 'bunch' of problems.
0,0,0,so he left you feeling empty
0,0,0,...and when did you start peeling this way?
0,0,0,People are always giving me the slip.
0,0,0,Do you want to talk about your feeling of being so stepped upon?
0,0,0,Don't beat yourself up. Not everyone can do comedy.
0,0,0,I have these urges to go out and slip side away.
0,0,0,You're saying everyone you love always slips up.
0,0,0,My life has been all slip-ups.
0,0,0,Oh, he must have slipped out.
0,0,0,Sometimes I just feel so empty inside.
0,0,0,Dr. I don't even know how to respond to your blatant sexual advances... I feel so empty.
0,0,0,Your answer puts you on the slippery slope.
0,0,0,You are a model character for separation anxiety.
0,0,0,I preferred the potato. It's not a banana lounge.
0,0,0,You feel the Chaplin estate owes your great great great great great great great... grandfather some royalties?
0,0,0,Tell me when you first realized that you were´t a couch potato?
0,0,0,Sounds like separation anxiety.
0,0,0,You're looking for assurance that you still have appeal, but isn't that a slippery slope?
0,0,0,Do you feel life slipping away?
0,0,0,I keep wondering, "Why me? Why did she need to slip on me?"
0,0,0,So your having split decisions?
0,0,0,And after you "went soft," then what?
0,0,0,She literally tore me open and devoured my flesh. I don't know if I can go on.
0,0,0,It really isn't what's inside that counts
0,0,0,I'm simply suggesting that sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,you feel no one takes you seriously
0,0,0,So the banana fana fofana has been hard to live with,correct?
0,0,0,I give up. What makes a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Not another case of split personality disorder...
0,0,0,So you say you've lost your appeal?
0,0,0,Let's focus on being less under foot and more in hand.
0,0,0,Nonsense. You are a peeling.
0,0,0,I just can't shake this feeling that I already have one foot in the grave.
0,0,0,Listen Doc, I'm fallen apart.
0,0,0,You might want to reconsider your position. It is a slippery slope you are on.
0,0,0,Leaving the sidewalks to join the circus could make you more appeeling
0,0,0,Why do you think your feelings are so easily bruised
0,0,0,I know exactly what it's like to be used by a big ape.
0,0,0,Let's focus on how you're feeling on the outside.
0,0,0,Tell me more about why you think you're not appealing.
0,0,0,I do apologize, sir. I missed breakfast.
0,0,0,You're right, I sabotaged that relationship by trying to make him fall too hard, too fast.
0,0,0,I can give you the name of a good spa.
0,0,0,Sure, on the surface you're bananas. But deep down inside you're clearly nuts.
0,0,0,You clearly have a case of banana split personality.
0,0,0,So you don't think you have appeal?
0,0,0,How dare you suggest I slip into something more comfortable!
0,0,0,How does that make you feel when you're called a fruit?
0,0,0,Let's find the inner you.
0,0,0,Have you ever thought that maybe other people are afraid of walking all over you?
0,0,0,The split-up was very painful.
0,0,0,Yes it's the latest in therapeutic-listening. If I sit in exactly the same way you do, I won't slip up.
0,0,0,And what is it about looking at me that makes you so sure Darwin got it, as you say, all wrong.
0,0,0,I know it's wrong, but I think I'm falling for you.
0,0,0,Right, so the banana peel identity is the comedian and the banana is the sex object?
0,0,0,People fall for you because it's your appeal? No,t hat is not a Freudian slip!
0,0,0,How old were you when your parents split?
0,0,0,You know, I didn't say it has to be a Freudian slip...
0,0,0,Mr. Peel, calling your entire family bananas does seem like a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,You're starting to appeal to me.
0,0,0,Why do you think you slipped up again?
0,0,0,What constitutes "appeal" can be very slippery, as you know.
0,0,0,Tell me how you felt when you peeled.
0,0,0,Does anybody else in your family have the same problem?
0,0,0,Together we can help you rediscover your inner strength.
0,0,0,Let's peel back another layer to uncover your roots.
0,0,0,Your problem is not unusual, it's banana envy.
0,0,0,Yes, I see many cases of banana split personality disorder.
0,0,0,I'd say you have a slippery personality.
0,0,0,I've been feeling very empty since the split
0,0,0,Mrs. Peel ran off with Steed?
0,0,0,You need to stop blaming yourself for the slip ups of others.
0,0,0,Don't judge yourself by those who slip on you.
0,0,0,After the split, how did you peel?
0,0,0,Yes, and Mr. Bad stole you, the real banana inside.
0,0,0,Let's start with why you believe Mr. Trump is obsessed with you.
0,0,0,I hear you've lost your sense of humor.
0,0,0,Really now? You think you're opening up?
0,0,0,Gretta, life isn't always going to be vitamins C, B-6 and potassium.
0,0,0,Maybe you should see someone more Freudian.
0,0,0,Nothing really appeals to me anymore.
0,0,0,So, your feelings of abandonment make you want to hurt people?
0,0,0,It's just that I've never fell for a client before.
0,0,0,I know we've talked about the neatness, and we've talked about the oral fixation, but there's still something missing...
0,0,0,So when were your first thoughts about this murder - suicide plan?
0,0,0,No, an onion! We're trying to peel an onion here!
0,0,0,I feel deserted.
0,0,0,"When was it that things started slipping away'?
0,0,0,Lately, I've been feeling empty inside
0,0,0,Do you consider yourself to be low, average or high in potassium?
0,0,0,When did you first self-identify as a joke?
0,0,0,So, you feel guilty about the part you played in the Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Never call yourself 'trash' when you are undeniably compostable.
0,0,0,Even though you have no substance, you can still have appeal.
0,0,0,That's not really what we consider a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Well, we start by peeling back all the layers.
0,0,0,So,how long have you felt like you were really a plantain on the inside?
0,0,0,She pierced my veil of aromatic happiness and found I was all rotten inside.
0,0,0,"I see . . . . and how did that make you peel?
0,0,0,Whenever I slip up, everyone laughs.
0,0,0,I'm afraid my lunch hour is almost up.
0,0,0,Well now, that was an interesting slip.
0,0,0,I caused him to slip and fall...
0,0,0,This week, Freud doesn't inspire. Let's just move on.
0,0,0,That's getting into a slippery slope.
0,0,0,When did this empty feeling start?
0,0,0,When do YOU think everyone laughs at you?
0,0,0,But no one should ever compare you to an apple or to an orange.
0,0,0,"That one slipped right by me".
0,0,0,I've been empty inside since the split
0,0,0,And then they called me 'yella'.
0,0,0,So what makes you say that you've been feeling empty lately?
0,0,0,What do YOU think the tailpipe dream means?
0,0,0,But the situation with Inky and Blotchy was completely different.
0,0,0,Now that you've opened up, let's talk about what's eating you.
0,0,0,Is that what you expected to happen?
0,0,0,You're slick, but I don't relish a seated slide
0,0,0,So you feel hollow, useless, and an impending sense of doom?
0,0,0,You don't want to join the Banana Peal Challenge"
0,0,0,Now,, tell me how your really peel. Now, tell me how you really peel. [put really in italics)
0,0,0,Yes, those brown spots are a sign of aging, but you were still good on the inside.
0,0,0,Sounds like a case of separation anxiety.
0,0,0,So, when did you notice things beginning to slip around you?
0,0,0,I think I know just the thing to help with your feelings of emptiness.
0,0,0,I'm not trying to hurt anyone; I just want to be noticed.
0,0,0,So, it's obvious why you're here. You should know I charge a bunch.
0,0,0,Stepping on a banana peel isn't the same as a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Why don't you like banana cream pie?
0,0,0,I don't think they necessarily want to walk all over you anymore...
0,0,0,Me! Me! Why is everybody slipping on Me?
0,0,0,So, when did you start to feel that you were beginning to slip?
0,0,0,You have appeal, but you seem to lack substance.
0,0,0,So you feel you have slipped up
0,0,0,Doctor- I feel so empty inside.
0,0,0,You can't take it personally that they say it's what's on the inside that matters.
0,0,0,Why do you think your always tripping people up?
0,0,0,How long have you been unfulfilled?
0,0,0,I am glad you are able to peel back your feelings.
0,0,0,Can you say more about what is inside you?
0,0,0,How did you feel when your wife said you had lost your appeal?
0,0,0,I knew some of my patients would be fruity, but this is a bit much.
0,0,0,Believe me, beauty IS skin deep.
0,0,0,Maybe you should just be grateful. The cartoon business has gotten you this far.
0,0,0,So when did you first stop seeing yourself as appealing?
0,0,0,We've been making progress, but lately it seems that you're slipping a little.
0,0,0,You need to accept that they're laughing with you, not at you.
0,0,0,It's been real,baby,but I gotta split.
0,0,0,What do you mean you life's a joke?
0,0,0,Can you get a grip?
0,0,0,He told me I'd lost my appeal, and then he split.
0,0,0,Tell me how you peel about that.
0,0,0,Well, you are slippery.
0,0,0,Patient: "Dr., I think I've lost my appeal." Doctor: "Nope, you've just gone bananas"
0,0,0,I am afraid you are suffering from a split personality
0,0,0,Again, let's discuss why your wife thinks you're yellow, slippery, and can't be trusted."
0,0,0,So when did you start feeling that you had lost your appeal?
0,0,0,Please walk me through the split again.
0,0,0,Tell me about your last Freudian slip
0,0,0,It is true, you aren't The Fruit that everyone gets excited about.
0,0,0,So, try though you do, you're unable to get anyone to fall for you? Is that it?
0,0,0,The therapy requires more than skin.
0,0,0,Your wife, Orange Peel, says you won't help with the kids.
0,0,0,I have a great feeling of emptiness inside.
0,0,0,Calm down, sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,A split personality is perfectly normal.
0,0,0,I understand you're slippery but you sure aren't nuts
0,0,0,I'd like to suggest our Fruit Salad group therapy for you.
0,0,0,It's not funny when they fall on you!
0,0,0,It all started when me and my boyfriend broke-up. Thus the creation of banana split.
0,0,0,You say you feel empty and hollow? I'm going to prescribe one clown slipping.
0,0,0,Let's start with, 'nanner, nanner, boo boo'.
0,0,0,So where do you think this need to separate and split from the bunch comes from?
0,0,0,(Writing) Banana feels like focal point of blame and is tired of people instantly pointing their fingers to him after hilarious or stupid slips, trips, and/or falls.
0,0,0,No. You're not paranoid. Everyone IS blaming you for their slip-ups. How does that make you feel?
0,0,0,You don't understand, doctor. I've hurt so many people.
0,0,0,I should have worn more sensible shoes
0,0,0,Have you ever asked why you feel the need to open yourself up to complete strangers?
0,0,0,So why do you say "just" a banana?
0,0,0,Well, so much for self-actualization.
0,0,0,So, they laughed at you when he slipped on you?
0,0,0,Doc, I just feel like I'm an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,What is troubling with you!
0,0,0,So, when did you first notice this sense of feeling hollow?
0,0,0,When did you notice that people are trying to avoid you?
0,0,0,So, how long these feelings of being the cause of downfalls?
0,0,0,How do you peel about this?
0,0,0,So you feel that you open yourself up too much in relationships?
0,0,0,You've had one too many daiquiris.
0,0,0,So what makes you think you're so unappeeling?
0,0,0,I'm sorry but as a professional I see my patients only in metaphor.
0,0,0,Don't give up, someone will fall for you.
0,0,0,So you're not top banana anymore ...... get over it!
0,0,0,I feel my life slipping away.
0,0,0,How long have you had this slipping fetish?
0,0,0,Can you remember when it was, exactly, that you started feeling this... "lack of humor?"
0,0,0,I'll be charging you double because of the split personality.
0,0,0,So, what would you say triggered this feeling of complete emptiness?
0,0,0,Fee, fie, fofamma what?
0,0,0,I know the extra competition is stressful, but it's only once every four years.
0,0,0,Well they shouldn't have walked over me in the first place.
0,0,0,And sometimes I think I am a shelled nut.
0,0,0,You say you're always "the fall guy." How does that make you feel?
0,0,0,So, you feel guilty about causing people to slip.Pee
0,0,0,Can we hurry this along, I've gotta split?
0,0,0,We all get stepped on from time to time.
0,0,0,Tell me more about your feeling of emptiness.
0,0,0,Your absolutely ripe.
0,0,0,Was it wonderful for you?
0,0,0,...no I do not my phone number out after the first appointment .
0,0,0,It would be a real "slip" up if we had a cartoon contest that wasn't set in a therapy session!
0,0,0,How was life after the split?
0,0,0,It's a clear case of split personality.
0,0,0,Doc...I'm just not peeling very well lately
0,0,0,When was the first time you felt yourself slipping?
0,0,0,It's progress that you finally opened up to me!
0,0,0,Why do you think you keep attracting the wrong people?
0,0,0,You say it feels like everyone in your life keeps slipping away?
0,0,0,When did you realize you had a compulsion to cause people to slip and fall?
0,0,0,What made you think you could slip that by me?
0,0,0,I think all of my troubles started after my parents split
0,0,0,next time I want to talk to both of you
0,0,0,Tell me about your relationship with Pogo
0,0,0,I feel empty since our split.
0,0,0,Have you ever tried going for a laugh that wasn't at somebody else's expense?
0,0,0,Could be worse…at least you’re not nuts.
0,0,0,And why do you think no one takes your seriously?
0,0,0,Have you considered that this desire to watch me peel might be just a bit of transference?
0,0,0,Try thinking of yourself as a simple fruit instead of a complex carb.
0,0,0,Indeed a slippery slope to be top banana again.
0,0,0,I could see how a sudden split would make you go bananas
0,0,0,That sounds more like a Freudian slip to me.
0,0,0,And it was after I lost my full ride to UVA, for tripping a kid in my ante-bellum south class for calling me "bananas," again, and he broke his nose, that I first started peeling depressed.
0,0,0,We don't use the "B" word in psychotherapy.
0,0,0,Stop obsessing about your black spots. You look great for two days old.
0,0,0,They're not laughing at you. They're laughing at what you've caused.
0,0,0,I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who think you're still funny.
0,0,0,It's normal. I'd say that most peels feel empty inside.
0,0,0,Why shouldn't they step on me? Obviously, something's missing.
0,0,0,I'm suspecting a potassium deficiency.
0,0,0,Not only can I tell what part of you is missing, I can assure you it was delicious.
0,0,0,What makes you say your appeal has slipped?
0,0,0,How old were you when your father split?
0,0,0,You have a split personality disorder.
0,0,0,Every week, you come in here and tell me that you think people are laughing at you behind your back. Get over yourself.
0,0,0,You've lost that loving peeling.
0,0,0,We generally don't mean banana peels when we talk about Freudian slips.
0,0,0,As I'm sure you know, it's a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I'm always the fall guy.
0,0,0,I'm afraid we are on the slippery slope, Mr Cranston.
0,0,0,Do you feel that way about all vegetables?
0,0,0,You were consumed by the split?
0,0,0,He's clearly not into you any more.
0,0,0,I feel hollow inside, incomplete, a slippery joke.
0,0,0,Let's explore why you enjoy making people slip.
0,0,0,Sorry. 'Nuts' would have been more diplomatic
0,0,0,You may have a split personality.
0,0,0,Did it ever occur to you that you *are* the problem?
0,0,0,I'm aware that the word 'slip' discomfits you, but I am talking here of the Freudian variety.
0,0,0,Please, no slippery shibboleths
0,0,0,You're not a fruitcake Mr Banana, you've a split personality
0,0,0,Let me get this: "Peel peel bo-beel, Banana-fana po’ feel?"
0,0,0,Good news and bad news: You are not delusional
0,0,0,Hurry up. You're starting to fade.
0,0,0,Tell me how you made Dr. Freud slip.
0,0,0,How do you really peel?
0,0,0,People keep avoiding me.
0,0,0,A slip of the banana is not the fault of the mind.
0,0,0,About how long ago did you and your wife split?
0,0,0,And you think you're pretty splayed out liked that?
0,0,0,I'm having an existential crisis.
0,0,0,How long have you had this fear of composting?
0,0,0,I understand you feel empty at your loss of sexual metaphor.
0,0,0,I am so frustrated! They blame ME for all of the slip-ups at work!!
0,0,0,That's not what we mean by Freudian slip!
0,0,0,Oh dear! I don't think I will get any help from Jung or Freud on that one.
0,0,0,You need to stop blaming yourself for everyone else's slip-ups.
0,0,0,Do you think, perhaps, at some at some level, your mother's inability to express affection, and not your comedic impulse, might be behind your need to be stepped on?
0,0,0,Who told you you have any anthropomorphic qualities?
0,0,0,Have you ever considered that maybe they're not laughing at you, that maybe they're laughing with you.
0,0,0,What do you mean you're tired of tripping people up?
0,0,0,You made who slip?
0,0,0,"And how do you peel about that?"-woman "Tear-able"-Banana
0,0,0,I am still trying to get in touch with my inner child.
0,0,0,I am being replaced by kale!
0,0,0,Yes, it's hard to get over a split.
0,0,0,Our time is up now. Please cleanup your string residue this time.
0,0,0,When I said I wanted you to be open with me, that's not exactly what I meant
0,0,0,Then she got all nuts, so I split.
0,0,0,It's biological.
0,0,0,You're bipeeler.
0,0,0,If you want to you can be as funny as pie in the face
0,0,0,Now, let's pretend that I'm a therapist and that you're a bana - oops, you are, a banana peel.
0,0,0,That's a pretty slippery answer to my question.
0,0,0,Why did you insist that we meet on a Sunday. Is this a joke to you?
0,0,0,Lets try focusing on the chimp.
0,0,0,That, Mr. Cavendish, is what we psychoanalysts refer to as a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,So . . . you think that your life lacks substance?
0,0,0,My friends think I have appeal, but my enemies say I'm a slippery character
0,0,0,It's just a confidence issue Doc, in social circles I feel like I'm always being stepped on, and you know with my history that I can't afford another slip-up.
0,0,0,Sounds like you're afraid of hurting people.
0,0,0,Your confused? I'm talking to a banana with mother issues.
0,0,0,So your great grandmother caused his first one?
0,0,0,No one takes me seriously !
0,0,0,Any issues other than experiencing an empty feeling?
0,0,0,I'm peeling very depressed. My girlfriend wanted to split.
0,0,0,I appreciate the offer, but it's a slippery slope.
0,0,0,No, I don't think your slips are Freudian.
0,0,0,I can only agree - peeling from the bottom is simply... inhuman.
0,0,0,In your case a paranoid fear of body snatchers may not be unreasonable.
0,0,0,You need to stop tripping people up.
0,0,0,Personally, when choosing a partner I look more for substance than a peel.
0,0,0,Tell me, how long have you been feeling unappealing?
0,0,0,I understand it isn't easy to open up to me without your bunch
0,0,0,I was kicked out of the Berries restroom and they demanded I show them my seeds.
0,0,0,So, she said your split left her with a bitter after taste?
0,0,0,Let me get this straight; you caused the Freudian slip?
0,0,0,On the phone, you said something was eating away at you...
0,0,0,So, I see you have lost your inner being. Tell me more.
0,0,0,If you slip on me, would it be Freudian ?
0,0,0,It's a textbook case of banana split personality.
0,0,0,You have absolutely no sex appeal. And NO, I'm not falling for you. Top banana indeed.
0,0,0,I’ll be honest. You’re an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,So, making people fall down helps with your post-partum depression?
0,0,0,you procrastinated and did not pay your slip & fall premium ?
0,0,0,Why do you think it was a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,You know you're pretty rotten for letting your other half go
0,0,0,But how did it make you peel?
0,0,0,You have to face the fact that you're trash.
0,0,0,You present quite literally. You have a split personality disorder.....
0,0,0,So, you and ice cream. Tell me about the split.
0,0,0,The clowns are trying to kill me. I've been stepped on 37 times this week.
0,0,0,How long have you had this fear that if you let your guard down then you will be peeled and eaten?
0,0,0,Do you think this is funny? I told you never to come here.
0,0,0,Tell me more about feeling empty
0,0,0,So, you feel your life is slip, sliding away.
0,0,0,Let's talk now about peelings and emotions.
0,0,0,My parents are both high achievers. No room for slip ups.
0,0,0,Looking back, I should never have agreed to the split.
0,0,0,So when did you develop this fear of monkeys?
0,0,0,I'm thinking split personality.
0,0,0,So your innermost fear is losing your purpose in life?
0,0,0,I just can't figure out what this peeling is...
0,0,0,I feel like I've lost my sex appeal
0,0,0,And how did the split make you feel?
0,0,0,How long have you felt like trash?
0,0,0,Perhaps you'd feel more appealing if you stopped making so many banana puns.
0,0,0,I'm just saying that describing this as mean-spirited belittling language may be a bit of an overreaction. Some people may choose, depending upon the circumstances, to see you simply as a piece of fruit, and refer to you as such.
0,0,0,I get this rush when someone slips on me and cries out in pain. Is that normal?
0,0,0,So what you are saying is, your parents are trippin'.
0,0,0,I feel like my whole life's been a joke.
0,0,0,Believe me, it's no use crying over spilled milk.
0,0,0,Well then, tell them you feel like you were born an herb and you refuse to be put in the fruit section.
0,0,0,You didn't see the split coming?
0,0,0,What's wrong, you're usually happy to see me.
0,0,0,-Honey, what should we get from the store? Besides bananas?
0,0,0,So, tell me about the emptiness you say you're feeling.
0,0,0,"Do you still feel stigma from the time you were a fruit?
0,0,0,All of my training points to 'Edible Complex.'
0,0,0,I thought this one might be monkeying around with me.
0,0,0,"So why do you think you're a banana peel?'
0,0,0,What? I'm not suppose to show you my insides? I thought that's what therapy is all about.
0,0,0,Tell me more about your split.
0,0,0,Do you want to slip on something more comfortable?
0,0,0,Divorce can be devastating, but nothing compares to a banana split.
0,0,0,Now how do these dreams of clowns stepping on you make you feel?
0,0,0,Yes, you do have a remarkable ability to become whatever you want to be. Nevertheless, until the Supreme Court reverses its decision, let's stick with what's on your birth certificate.
0,0,0,Let me get this right - when the bunch you hung out with turned too bad you peeled off and got yourself a new skin ?
0,0,0,I feel like such a cliche.
0,0,0,Just because you have pointy heads, yellowed skin and are bent over doesn't mean you're not lovable."
0,0,0,Tell me, how does that make you peel?
0,0,0,I am just known as a "a piece of fruitcake".. what is your problem?
0,0,0,But do you see yourself as appealing?
0,0,0,My life has been on a slippery slope lately
0,0,0,How long have you been having these feelings of emptiness?
0,0,0,And why do you believe it is your fault?
0,0,0,I wasn't even his second banana.
0,0,0,Just remember as we peel back your childhood, things can get slippery.
0,0,0,If it makes you feel any better, I ate you for more than your flavor.
0,0,0,The question isn’t, why didn’t they laugh? The question is, why do you think it’s funny?
0,0,0,donkey kong ate my wife and children
0,0,0,So, your father always wanted an apple?
0,0,0,Can you tell me what's eating you up inside?
0,0,0,Clear case of split personality here...
0,0,0,I didn't say you were JUST a banana.
0,0,0,So tell me. When exactly did you start feeling things slipping away?
0,0,0,When did you first start to feel that you were different?
0,0,0,Was there one sibling that you felt closest to?
0,0,0,Everything with you is subconscious.
0,0,0,It's just that you have a threatening look about you.
0,0,0,Throughout our therapy sessions, you sure have peeled your soul to me.
0,0,0,I can't begin to help you if you won't talk.
0,0,0,I can't believe you said you found me 'a peeling'
0,0,0,Who told you your feathers aren't fine?
0,0,0,Was this the first time you opened up to someone and got hurt?
0,0,0,. . . but in your case whipped cream, nuts and fudge are suggestive of a split personality . . .
0,0,0,So that's what you meant by "riding shotgun!"
0,0,0,I think we're split on this issue...
0,0,0,Actually, you ARE the butt of a lot of jokes.
0,0,0,So you identify as a plantain in a banana peel…
0,0,0,So you think your divorce took a lot out of you?
0,0,0,I think we should explore further this experience of losing yourself.
0,0,0,So you have the mind of a mango, but the body of a banana?
0,0,0,For the last time, my falling on you would not be a Freudian slip.... It's called transference.
0,0,0,You are not nuts. You're a fruit.
0,0,0,You feel that no one takes you seriously.
0,0,0,I won't be able to help you until we peel back some of that thick skin of yours.
0,0,0,So, this is what we have so far: 'I just don't feel like I've got enough inner fruit'...
0,0,0,It's not your fault that Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee for President.
0,0,0,How does it make you feel that she left you for a guy who works the top of a steep staircase?
0,0,0,I understand your guilt complex about the ones you've hurt, but remember, you're the one getting stepped on.
0,0,0,I think the problem is that you have a split personality.
0,0,0,What do you mean "jump right out of your skin"?
0,0,0,Banana-fanna-fo-fanna-fee-fi-fo-fanna----and this was a game he would play with you?
0,0,0,Don't blame yourself for slipping up - it happens to the best of us.
0,0,0,Why do you feel that your life is a slippery slope?
0,0,0,No, it's not a cliche to feel emasculated
0,0,0,Doctor, I have this recurring dream of someone slipping on me while standing next to an open grave.
0,0,0,You're a Freudian slip waiting to happen.
0,0,0,Ugh! He is forgetting to take his peels again.
0,0,0,It's just that I feel so empty inside....
0,0,0,And the guy dumped you for a gerbil?
0,0,0,Let's talk about your split personality.
0,0,0,So you don't feel very appealing now?
0,0,0,Is this real life or am I in therapy?
0,0,0,My advice is you can't let the world eat your insides out.
0,0,0,No slips and falls this week - is that your problem?
0,0,0,You're a mere shell of yourself, all spent.
0,0,0,- Hard-core drug addiction, edible overdoses, Monsanto poisonings . . . - It's not your fault, it's not your fault
0,0,0,I don't think they're laughing at you, per se.
0,0,0,,,,,so...after the banana split, you were an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,Why yes, I am Freudian trained. Why do you ask?
0,0,0,Yes, tentacle envy is a real condition.
0,0,0,I'm sure that was just a slip of the tongue.
0,0,0,Why do you think I find you appalling? You are actually appealing.
0,0,0,I was top banana until I lost my wife on a Sundae.
0,0,0,I don't think my smoking you is going to help anyone.
0,0,0,LSD? Find a shrink in Hollywood.
0,0,0,I don't think they're laughing *at* you.
0,0,0,They're not completely without fault. After all, yellow does signal caution.
0,0,0,When did you first experience these empty feelings?
0,0,0,So why did your better half split-up with you?
0,0,0,What makes you think you lost your soul?
0,0,0,That's just the low potassium level talking.
0,0,0,I could see how you would think you are causing her to slip into old habits.
0,0,0,An orange is round just like an apple. Why can't it be apples and bananas?
0,0,0,How do you feel about causing the first Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Tell me why you think you're not appealing?
0,0,0,Hmm...identity issues ? Before we begin, are you Dole or Chiquita ? You all look the same without the sticker.
0,0,0,It appears you have a split personality.
0,0,0,How long has it been since you "went bananas?"
0,0,0,Stop treating yourself like outdated gag.
0,0,0,You have to stop letting people walk all over you, Nana.
0,0,0,No, I do not find you a-peeling.
0,0,0,musa acuminata! this abracadabra of last resort drawn from my bag of tricks! once edible feed stock regenerated, ye can wag once again in verboten fruitful glory. i strongly advise you lug a left handed monkey wrench to ban anna from devouring you.
0,0,0,How does it make you feel when you can't get approval from the top banana ?
0,0,0,I want to help peel back the layers.
0,0,0,Tell me about your slippery days.
0,0,0,You slipped? You need to go back to rehab.
0,0,0,Your plans for office, realistically show lack in your peel.
0,0,0,Orange you glad I didn't say apple?
0,0,0,How long before you knew you were on a slippery slope?
0,0,0,Mr. Burger, don't be so literal about losing your case on appeal.
0,0,0,Let's explore why you often feel compelled to make people laugh at the expense of others.
0,0,0,The encounter you say tore your guts out, yet you believe you have enough stuff left inside to plan some impish underfooted revenge?
0,0,0,Freudian slips are not your fault.
0,0,0,Just because you had a slip, we don't have to split.
0,0,0,But what about MY peelings!
0,0,0,How long have you felt empty inside?
0,0,0,Sorry, I am strictly Jungian.
0,0,0,So tell me when did you lose yourself?
0,0,0,Quit looking at my legs--I'm not a slippery person.
0,0,0,I don't know what it is. I just have this empty feeling.
0,0,0,Tell me more about these abandonment issues.
0,0,0,When I was I kid, I was picked on and ever since my feelings have been split.
0,0,0,Why do you feel empty inside?
0,0,0,...and you think subconsciously you wanted him to slip?
0,0,0,So the word 'schlepped' bothers you?'
0,0,0,Sorry, I don't date my patients.
0,0,0,Let's go back to the time you made that Freudian slip...
0,0,0,He can't just slip out !
0,0,0,You need to come out of your skin.
0,0,0,Look on the bright side. You've still got appeal.
0,0,0,Let's call it "a banana slip"
0,0,0,Sorry, I did not intend to unpeel you!
0,0,0,How about we go back to your taking metaphors literally?
0,0,0,Even the "top banana" may eventually slip.
0,0,0,So tell me how you felt the first time someone slipped on you.
0,0,0,I feel that I can't control my slippery relationship with people.
0,0,0,Well, in your case going bananas may not be all that bad.
0,0,0,So they fall for you, but they don't fall for you.
0,0,0,I want to split with Sundae.
0,0,0,I'm sorry to hear that. How are you coping with the split?
0,0,0,.... regardless, I don't patients.
0,0,0,'Tell me more about how you think the chimpanzee was using you in your relationship.'
0,0,0,You mentioned a feeling of emptiness...do you have this feeling often?
0,0,0,When did you first notice you're appeal to others?
0,0,0,Well, it all started when Carmen Miranda and I first met.
0,0,0,When did you begin to first think of yourself as a banana?
0,0,0,Then the slipping, falling, cracking, and screaming.
0,0,0,I propose you're using a defense mechanism we call 'banana splitting.'
0,0,0,It's healthy to peal away your inner self and not go bananas.
0,0,0,What's this about Harry Belafonte?
0,0,0,After Barney the Banana described in detail his intimate dreams about her, his therapist decided it was time for him to split.
0,0,0,you have to stop obsessing over banana splits
0,0,0,And how are you taking the split?
0,0,0,I'm here because of a split.
0,0,0,So tell me how you are peeling today.
0,0,0,I think it goes back to the day my father split.
0,0,0,Maybe if I stare at this banana long enough, it'll turn into the mother I knew
0,0,0,You just think you love me.
0,0,0,I'm diagnosing you a slipzophrenic.
0,0,0,No more Freudian slip jokes, OK?
0,0,0,Yes George, I recognize how this kind of redundancy only adds to your sense of futility.
0,0,0,Now that you're no longer a phallic symbol, do you still feel you have a skin in the game?
0,0,0,I just feel like I'm a big joke.
0,0,0,And why do you think people keep falling for you?
0,0,0,So, you feel like you are always blamed when someone slips up.
0,0,0,I think this results from an edible complex.
0,0,0,Please stop with the 'Freudian slip' excuse - you're consciously being offensive.
0,0,0,Yes, some feelings are more slippery than others.
0,0,0,Let's talk family history - what, six hand, seven hand, eight hand bunch?
0,0,0,And how long have you felt like you've had a split personality?
0,0,0,Sometimes, people may not find you appealing.
0,0,0,I don't know Doc, I keep slipping up.
0,0,0,Your peel is open.
0,0,0,She doesn't laugh at your jokes?
0,0,0,But see the thing is, I would never consciously partake in a Freudian Slip. I was just laying on the ground minding my own business and the next thing I know....
0,0,0,Was that a slip, or are you holding yourself responsible?
0,0,0,Any regrets about your trip to the jungle?
0,0,0,I understand that you don't peel very well
0,0,0,It's not your fault he had one foot in the grave.
0,0,0,You appear to be a very slippery fellow.
0,0,0,I don't know what happened—I just feel empty inside.
0,0,0,And why do you think people are saying you're going bananas?
0,0,0,And you're insulted when people call you a fruit?
0,0,0,Would you mind if I leave first?
0,0,0,He slipped so I came instead.
0,0,0,And then she tossed me out like I was a piece of garbage or something!
0,0,0,So when did you first get the feeling that people were walking all over you?
0,0,0,It's just that I want to be special. I want to be the cherry on top. Who's that cherry think he is anyway!
0,0,0,Size doesn't always matter.
0,0,0,Just how often do you hear, "Day-O" ringing in your ears?
0,0,0,What would you like to be able to say to those monkeys?
0,0,0,So you have abandonment issues
0,0,0,You shouldn't let people put you down in the first place.
0,0,0,hey doc i think my father had banana split personality disorder !!!
0,0,0,How does it make you feel when people walk all over you?
0,0,0,There may be some lingering resentment.
0,0,0,Freudian slip jokes? You're right. Not funny.
0,0,0,...and now we wait for the Freudian slip.
0,0,0,..and when he fell everyone laughed and laughed but I just felt really sad for him. Am I depressed?
0,0,0,The bystanders who laughed may be feeling guilt too.
0,0,0,So... what I'm hearing is, it's one Freudian slip after another.
0,0,0,If we're going to solve your self-esteem issues, you're going to have to stop letting everyone walk all over you for a quick laugh.
0,0,0,Now that you've opened up, we can start to make progress.
0,0,0,And then she told me...that i wasn't ripe enough, so i split.
0,0,0,Have you looked for jobs in sex education?
0,0,0,"I felt used, discarded! ", Doc (sob) (sob)
0,0,0,It feels like I'm empty inside.
0,0,0,No Caitlyn, once it's gone, it's gone!
0,0,0,Why are all you macho guys called Chiquita?
0,0,0,Why do you feel you are a danger to others?
0,0,0,Alright Sigmund, sometimes a banana IS just a banana...is that what this is about?
0,0,0,You don't think it could've just been a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,So, what you're saying is that everything leads you down a slippery slope?
0,0,0,In my professional opinion ; Your appeal notwithstanding , you're a peel and quite bananas . Own it.
0,0,0,Every time I go outside, everyone goes backwards.
0,0,0,Sometimes a banana doesn't want to be just a banana.
0,0,0,I'm just trying to stay relevant.
0,0,0,I'm impressed by your agility to roll around on the floor. Now please get up on the couch and put your jacket back on.
0,0,0,It's "Oedipal", not "Edible".
0,0,0,I know this might seem unprofessional, but I just seem to find you more and more a-pealing...
0,0,0,How long have you been Trump's hair?
0,0,0,You have a thick skin.
0,0,0,Is that what I think it is!?
0,0,0,Sometimes Freud is just Freud.
0,0,0,You feel you are an accident waiting to happen, part of some cosmic, slapstick joke?
0,0,0,You've got to watch out for those Freudian slips.
0,0,0,I certainly understand why people keep falling for you.
0,0,0,Let's discuss your fear of fruit-based puns. What do you find so unappealing about them? Is it just that you've heard them a bunch? Sorry, I'm going to split.
0,0,0,Remind me what happened after the split
0,0,0,It doesn't matter what anyone says, you do have appeal.
0,0,0,Tell me more about this obsession with composting.
0,0,0,I am going to say some words, and you just say the first fruit that comes to your mind.
0,0,0,Since Conchita left me, the bunch has sided with her and now I am turning to mush; Doc, can you save my skin?
0,0,0,ED is often a symptom of other problems.
0,0,0,Your family was a bad bunch, but you're appealing.
0,0,0,Did you grow up in the middle?
0,0,0,Even my wife calls me a slippery piece of garbage.
0,0,0,I can just feel my life slipping away
0,0,0,Relax, You'll never be stalked again.
0,0,0,I don't think the fear of being composted has a name.
0,0,0,Why would you want to give up a career in comedy?
0,0,0,I am afraid that once you peel off all the layers we will find that I am just an empty shell.
0,0,0,There is not a banana in your pants, so are you sad to see me?
0,0,0,Let's discuss how you keep slipping toward me on that couch...
0,0,0,With keying technology it was only a matter of time before the stunt work dried up. Have you looked into still life retraining?
0,0,0,Get with the flow doc, spread out..
0,0,0,Maybe people are laughing with you, not at you?
0,0,0,I'm an empty shell of the man I once was.
0,0,0,Okay, so you left him because you no longer find him...uh...appealing?
0,0,0,Charlie Chaplin's whole career was defined by silent, physical humor, and he is a comedy legend.
0,0,0,And so, I think I hear you say you have appeal.
0,0,0,More importantly, do YOU think you have appeal?
0,0,0,That's not exactly what I meant when I said we would start to peel away some layers.
0,0,0,Let's work on finding your inner self.
0,0,0,That was a slip of the tongue.
0,0,0,When did you first notice that you were losing appeal?
0,0,0,I can tell you the very day my problem started. It was he first day of the second grade when they started calling me "Peanuts."
0,0,0,No, I don't want to slip into something a little more comfortable!
0,0,0,And why do YOU think they won't consider you for dramatic roles, Miss Peel?
0,0,0,And when did it start bothering you that these strings have no name?
0,0,0,Well, it's not REALLY all about who you are on the inside.
0,0,0,Well if you'er frustrated bc "Well, I'm sorry, but if you're depressed because you can not find a straight partner, this will require multiple sessions to resolve."
0,0,0,Would you say you caused the slip up?
0,0,0,I have never felt so empty.
0,0,0,Perhaps you feel that way because you actually are empty on the inside. ['are' should be underlined]
0,0,0,Tell me more about the day your parents split.
0,0,0,Hey, wanna switch seats?
0,0,0,And how are you feeling since the banana split?
0,0,0,I didn't mean to step on you. It was a Freudian slip...
0,0,0,Every time I get close to someone I split
0,0,0,But why do only think it's funny if someone gets hurt?
0,0,0,My last patient was nuts.
0,0,0,I told you it's the inner you that really matters.
0,0,0,You're suffering from a split personality.
0,0,0,Could you connect these feelings of emptiness with the impulse to make people slip?
0,0,0,Tell me about your parents' split.
0,0,0,AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO AVOID YOU?
0,0,0,So you see nothing in your future but brown spots, bruises, and banana peel jokes.
0,0,0,Sometimes I fantasize about being ravaged by a group of chimps, doc" "That's just an a-peel to your id- a phallic fixation
0,0,0,How did you feel after being discarded?
0,0,0,I just haven't been myself since we split.
0,0,0,Well it could just mean you've moved past the phallic stage.
0,0,0,Screw doctor-patient relations, you are appealing.
0,0,0,So you had a slip up...
0,0,0,Do you know what it's like having to hear hundreds of bad puns directed at you every day?
0,0,0,I've had patients without appeal, but never a peel without patience.
0,0,0,First, are you a starfish or a banana peel, as that may affect my diagnosis.
0,0,0,Oh god, he split on me....
0,0,0,There's no "coulda" "shoulda" "woulda" in slapstick.
0,0,0,I will not accept that "it was just a Freudian slip."
0,0,0,If you don't talk about your feelings, I'm afraid you'll just slip back into your old habits.
0,0,0,I ask you, am I wrong to be angry that Freud stole my punchline?
0,0,0,Sorry. Slip of the tongue.
0,0,0,I just can't peel back any more layers.
0,0,0,Let's leave the fruit behind, shall we?
0,0,0,Tell me about your Freudian slips.
0,0,0,You may be suffering from separation anxiety.
0,0,0,I think you'd be better off just admitting you're slippery
0,0,0,So, why'd you split?
0,0,0,No, I am not going to enable your penis envy any more. It's time to move on.
0,0,0,So he took the best part of you and threw the rest away. How does that make you feel?
0,0,0,It's clear you've lost touch with your inner self.
0,0,0,...and after the split, I met Foster...
0,0,0,But our attempts to probe your innermost self have been fruitless.
0,0,0,Tell me more about this Freudian slip.
0,0,0,That's one way to open up.
0,0,0,What's eating you this time?
0,0,0,I'm glad you're finally opening up.
0,0,0,You're a sadomasochist who inflicts pain by being stepped on?
0,0,0,So you see yourself as a catalyst for change?
0,0,0,I think you feel you have no core inside.
0,0,0,To be honest, there's a reason everyone treats you like some sort of joke.
0,0,0,Should I bill Dole or Chiquita for your therapy?
0,0,0,Is there any particular time of day when you feel as though you are a banana peel?
0,0,0,You want to be more than just A Peeling?
0,0,0,You say you feel you're an accident waiting to happen?
0,0,0,And when someone slipped on you, how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,You feel like the world's been stepping on you.
0,0,0,First off, you've got to stop blaming yourself.
0,0,0,Tricky tentacles? I'll just take your word for it.
0,0,0,Actually, you're my first post-op banana.
0,0,0,So you aren't happy to see me?
0,0,0,Really, you must let go of the guilt. You're the one who keeps getting stepped on!
0,0,0,It's normal to feel discarded, especially after the layers have been peeled away.
0,0,0,She tossed me for a plantain. And they say size doesn't matter!
0,0,0,It's only Freudian if you subconsciously wanted them to slip.
0,0,0,So, slapstick moved on to other fruits...how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,That ‘empty feeling’ often indicates a potassium deficiency.
0,0,0,Your insurance company will only pay for one of your split personalities.
0,0,0,i wish they saw that I was beautiful on the outside too.
0,0,0,How long have you had sexual attraction to other flowers
0,0,0,So you're not comfortable in your own skin...
0,0,0,...and then she said, "or are you just happy to see me...".
0,0,0,So, you're afraid of slipping on a human.
0,0,0,So people are always taking the fall for you?
0,0,0,I hate it when people assume I only speak Spanish. I am really an educated Banana.
0,0,0,I just feel so lonely since she split.
0,0,0,Now, tell me what's eating you?
0,0,0,Sometimes I feel myself slipping back into my old ways.
0,0,0,Now that you have peeled away all my defences, can you put me back together?
0,0,0,I don’t know what it means, but I keep having this dream of people stepping on me and slipping.
0,0,0,My girlfriend, Olive, just doesn't understand me.
0,0,0,Let's discuss why you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,No, I can't say I've had any patients just like you.
0,0,0,Would you feel more comfortable on the floor ?
0,0,0,So, your wife complains that you've lost your appeal?
0,0,0,Do you recall when these feelings of emptiness began?
0,0,0,How long have you felt that there's something missing in your life
0,0,0,Tell me again how she loved your inner beauty.
0,0,0,I don't feel guilty if it was a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,So how long were you and this 'Chiquita' engaged?
0,0,0,I see. So you decided it was finally time to come out of the pocket.
0,0,0,I used to be the top banana, but now I feel it all slipping away.
0,0,0,My parents split so I was a foster child.
0,0,0,So tell me how you think your mind is slipping.
0,0,0,You need to stop blaming yourself for the accident.
0,0,0,It's not love, it's Doctor-peel transference
0,0,0,Tell me about your peelings.
0,0,0,So how long have you had these feelings of people always trying to undress you?
0,0,0,Do you sometimes peel all alone?
0,0,0,First of all, Streisand was singing Feelings not Peelings.
0,0,0,Tell me more about how your father caused your mother such embarrassment.
0,0,0,I always feel like an accident just waiting to happen.
0,0,0,I know you're upset but it's not your fault he slipped.
0,0,0,And you blame yourself for the split?
0,0,0,I think that we are on a slippery subject here.
0,0,0,This isn't always a fruitless exercise.
0,0,0,Origination of the Freudian Slip
0,0,0,I've got news for you. Sometimes a slip is just a slip.
0,0,0,I think that underneath that tough exterior, you’re actually rather sweet.
0,0,0,So tell me, doc . . . am I bananas?
0,0,0,So, which candidate do you imagine you'll land on?
0,0,0,Are you sure people are avoiding you?
0,0,0,Keep hanging out with that bunch and you'll lose your core value.
0,0,0,Shrink: "So tell me why you feel you are the butt of too many jokes..." Banana Peel: "Well, it's kind of a slippery slope..."
0,0,0,My inner self slipped away
0,0,0,So then he just split?
0,0,0,You know how it is...... one slip and you're no longer top banana.
0,0,0,Taking people down for laughs—have you considered how it might hurt them?
0,0,0,I just don't have it in me anymore.
0,0,0,Marischino cherry and whipped cream?
0,0,0,I think we've established that your anxiety started when your parents split.
0,0,0,You say your wife is a gluttonous baboon, Please explain.
0,0,0,Why do you feel the need to trip people?
0,0,0,So, when did you first notice you felt so empty inside?
0,0,0,So, why don't you tell me about the split?
0,0,0,Our goal is to face slapstick without the guilt.
0,0,0,Freudian slips are the least of my problems.
0,0,0,Why do YOU think you keep trying to give people the slip?
0,0,0,It's always apples versus oranges and I'm really starting to feel left out.
0,0,0,Actually, you're my first post-op trans-banana.
0,0,0,So you think you're responsible for the split?
0,0,0,Why do you think you keep slipping?
0,0,0,I'm glad you finally decided to open up...
0,0,0,Oh my, are you sure you're not really a plantain?
0,0,0,Hmm, I doubt whipped cream and a cherry would fill that empty feeling for long.
0,0,0,My soul was rotten...
0,0,0,Everybody has a fear of composting.
0,0,0,We discussed invisibility as a side effect ... but I'm going to mark that your "Man Problems" have subsided
0,0,0,I just don't understand comedy anymore.
0,0,0,Fixing your low self-esteem will be a slippery slope.
0,0,0,You can be open here.
0,0,0,Sometimes we all feel empty inside. But when you fall down... well, you know.
0,0,0,I always wondered what made a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,When did you first start to feel unappealing?
0,0,0,I get it - 'a peal' - but climb back down and throw it out.
0,0,0,"Ate" is such a strong word.
0,0,0,No one blames you.
0,0,0,I have a bunch of strategies for you.
0,0,0,I think you are ready for group sessions with the rest of the bunch.
0,0,0,Sometimes I don't know about you.
0,0,0,How can I put this, you have appeal, but no substance.
0,0,0,Since you're still feeling empty inside, I think it's time we put you on a different SSRI.
0,0,0,You haven't mentioned your parents.
0,0,0,Quick, New Yorker, get some good cartoons or you're going to fold
0,0,0,do you self-identify as split?
0,0,0,Something seems to be eating you up inside.
0,0,0,And when would you say that you first noticed the yellow fleshy part of you get squeezed out of your life?
0,0,0,Why do you feel you're always the fall guy?
0,0,0,This is carrying a Freudian slip too far.
0,0,0,You've been hanging with the wrong bunch.
0,0,0,Let's explore these feelings of emptiness.
0,0,0,Don Tr***, we know your size, STOP peeling off!
0,0,0,Just because Tyler wants to go out of state to college doesn't mean he is rejecting you as a mother.
0,0,0,So you feel like part of you has been missing ever since the incident with the gorilla?
0,0,0,I've been feeling empty ever since my banana split from me.
0,0,0,So you feel you've lost your manhood?
0,0,0,For this therapy, we simply peel the layers to see what is inside . . .
0,0,0,Another split personality issue flare up, huh?
0,0,0,Life hasn't been the same since the split
0,0,0,Tough skin, but empty inside. You remind me of my ex.
0,0,0,I see you're peeling better
0,0,0,Don't over analyze it. Sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,It sounds like you feel like you're losing your grip on things, is that correct?
0,0,0,i guess you slipped up when you split...
0,0,0,So after you and your wife split ... er separated!... then you went on a bender - sorry - Freudian slip... oh! oops...
0,0,0,I understand your concern, but not every slip is necessarily Freudian.
0,0,0,I caught my wife with another banana and she told me to peel out.
0,0,0,Since our last session, I see you decided to take my advice and release your inner banana.
0,0,0,Why do you think he split?
0,0,0,It seems a bit late to be worrying about size.
0,0,0,Are you surprised you let that slip?
0,0,0,It's not unusual for a banana peel to want to be an octopus.
0,0,0,I believe we are dealing with edible issues.
0,0,0,Tell me about yourself.
0,0,0,Yellow is a color, not an emotion.
0,0,0,Now I understand what they meant by "side-effects."
0,0,0,You have to take responsibility; that wasn't a Freudian slip!
0,0,0,So when you yelled back, 'Eat my lunch, Buddy!' what did you expect?
0,0,0,You feel like you are just one of the bunch?
0,0,0,So she says, "No, I don't like you. You're thin-skinned and slippery." Frankly, Doc, I was hurt. You find me appealing, don't you, Doc?
0,0,0,Let's focus on the day he left you for a smoothie.
0,0,0,I just cant keep people around, they all just slip away.
0,0,0,I feel like I'm always slipping up when I'm around people.
0,0,0,Will that be all, sir?
0,0,0,I’m referring you to Dr. Slapstick. You’re too slippery for me.
0,0,0,Orange you glad you are not a banana?
0,0,0,Let me see whether I understand you. You think that peeling back your emotions will produce a slippery slope?
0,0,0,So you deny responsibility, saying the doctor’s fall was a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,As Freud said, sometimes a slip is just a slip.
0,0,0,Why these are Manolo Blahniks, why do you ask?
0,0,0,I'd like to refer you to a Skinnerian.
0,0,0,I know you say you just happened to be on the sidewalk, but do you think unconsciously you wanted him to fall?
0,0,0,So when she cut off your inner banana and tossed it into a smoothie, you just split?
0,0,0,So, when did you first have this feeling that people were avoiding you?
0,0,0,No, no, I said you have a three-STAGE condition.
0,0,0,So... She went ape over you?
0,0,0,How does allowing things to slip make you feel?
0,0,0,It sounds like the issues started after your split.
0,0,0,Why sidewalks?
0,0,0,Why do you feel being unpeeled makes you unappealing?
0,0,0,What I put on my breakfast cereal isn't relevant to your therapy session, Mr. Cavendish.
0,0,0,And remember, the next Big Slip Up is right around the corner.
0,0,0,Emasculated how?
0,0,0,Ever consider a career in comedy?
0,0,0,o Mr. B. tell me how you peel about your visit to the yogurt factory.
0,0,0,Did you always know you were funny?
0,0,0,I can assure you...you ARE more than just a cliche
0,0,0,And how did you feel when Donald Trump started to call you 'Slippery Pete'?
0,0,0,And it was after he stepped on you that you started to feel empty inside?
0,0,0,You were ripe for a loss.
0,0,0,And when she said, 'You're the cause of most accidents', how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,Your actions will lead you down a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Yes, you are THE slippery slope.
0,0,0,What makes you feel everyone is trying to avoid you?
0,0,0,It's not your fault you were the banana peel his one foot was on.
0,0,0,You need to remind them that sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,And now you feel used?
0,0,0,OK. Start with Cruz,
0,0,0,Nothing seems to be appealing anymore.
0,0,0,Sorry -- I meant plantain.
0,0,0,First, stop giggling.
0,0,0,This isn't what I had in mind when I told you to have a little more skin in the game.
0,0,0,Tell me again why it was an accident?
0,0,0,Sitting in a chair will not make me fall for you.
0,0,0,Something's been eating you. Tell me about it.
0,0,0,Your insides have been sliced up, slathered in buttery sauce and ignited over a bed of vanilla ice cream? I'm afraid we'll need another session to unpack that metaphor, Mr. Foster.
0,0,0,Seems I've raised your attention.
0,0,0,I tend to hurt people who get close to me.
0,0,0,How does it feel when people leave you out?
0,0,0,So you're why so many Freudians slip...
0,0,0,You know there is no such thing as an 'Accidental slip'."
0,0,0,And you're afraid people think you have split personality?
0,0,0,I feel unappreciated.
0,0,0,Ok, give me the spiel...
0,0,0,My girlfriend says I don't appeal to her.
0,0,0,Every time someone gets close to me Doc, I feel like they just slip away.
0,0,0,As a clone, your sexual stages are limited.
0,0,0,About your feeling of emptiness inside...
0,0,0,Sorry I laughed. Go on...
0,0,0,Has seeing a male psychotherapist ever appealed to you?
0,0,0,I'd go to a 12-step meeting, but everyone blames me for slipping.
0,0,0,Gotta be a split personality. I'd bet a month of sundaes on it.
0,0,0,No, I'm afraid this will require more than Viagra®.
0,0,0,What does 'produce' mean to you?
0,0,0,That's just your paranoia, not everyone thinks you're a joke.
0,0,0,How should I feel? People just rip out my insides and throw me aside!
0,0,0,Not every decision is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I've always thought of myself as pretty easy to get along with but lately it seems like everyone feels the need to be overly cautious when they see me.
0,0,0,Naturally peeling and natural appeal are not the same thing.
0,0,0,' How long have you had these slipping sliding nightmares?'
0,0,0,"My professional opinion? You're bananas".
0,0,0,"When did realize that making people slip and fall made you happy?'
0,0,0,You say you feel empty inside?
0,0,0,I'm sorry it ended in a split.
0,0,0,Maybe making people slip and fall isn't for you. Have you considered composting?
0,0,0,I would never call you a 'fruit cake,' a 'banana nut' maybe.
0,0,0,Being part of a bunch lost its appeal?
0,0,0,You are my favorite patient, so I slipped on something comfortable.
0,0,0,I see your only skin deep.
0,0,0,You can't keep letting people get under your skin.
0,0,0,I feel like a shell of my former self. Does that make me sound bananas?
0,0,0,You are appealing then you think.
0,0,0,Can you elaborate on this empty feeling?
0,0,0,Yes, I do understand that that slip wasn't consciously intended.
0,0,0,If she can't see your appeal, that's her problem.
0,0,0,It must feel terrible to have everyone fall all over you
0,0,0,I know how difficult this split's been for you.
0,0,0,So how did you slip up?
0,0,0,'You came to this country and everyone liked you, so what made you feel like trash?'
0,0,0,How long have you had these feelings of emptiness inside you?
0,0,0,I'm not falling for you -- that's transference talking.
0,0,0,Your mother sounds like a real bitch.
0,0,0,Your guilt complex isn't difficult to understand.
0,0,0,I'm sorry to say it, but in your case you really are an accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE LOST YOUR APPEAL. I THINK YOU HAVE SIMPLY GONE BANANAS.
0,0,0,MY GOD YOU ATE THE BANNANA AND NOW YOUR HIM !
0,0,0,I know he slipped on you, but why exactly did you need to come here?
0,0,0,Do you need a more comfortable bed? You are falling apart in pieces.
0,0,0,I'm not delusional. I AM responsible for the first Freudian Slip!
0,0,0,Hey, a banana!
0,0,0,I was going to be a world famous computer logo....until that damn apple showed up.
0,0,0,When did you first feel that the people in your life were slipping away?
0,0,0,What do you think it is about you that trips people up?
0,0,0,The emptiness will fade. It's nothing more than a stage.
0,0,0,I'm sick and tired of being stepped on.
0,0,0,So when did you start feeling life was slipping away?
0,0,0,Tell me about the day you got your peelings hurt.
0,0,0,Now, let's tak about your split
0,0,0,Accidents happen. How you deal with them is what matters most.
0,0,0,I know you have come a long way, but size does not determine my fee.
0,0,0,Oh, I see... so what does this "stepping on" have to do with your morale?
0,0,0,Our session has ended. It's time for you to make like a tree and leave.
0,0,0,Did I just see a gorilla got off that lounger and left a banana peel on it?
0,0,0,When did you feel that you were accident prone?
0,0,0,Explain what you mean by "everything is slipping away"
0,0,0,It seems my last patient left their banana peel on my chair.
0,0,0,I understand your frustration but you're a comedic icon and the transition to drama will be a challenge.
0,0,0,I understand you're not peeling very well.
0,0,0,Your case has no appeal for me.
0,0,0,I think you'll find this feeling of emptiness is just part of the modern condition.
0,0,0,The good news is you're not going bananas. The bad news is it's cause you're already there.
0,0,0,I'm just a shell of myself
0,0,0,Tell me more about this recurring nightmare that starts with someone asking, “Is that a banana in your pocket…”
0,0,0,We need to peel back a bit more.
0,0,0,And how do feel when they call you "banana face"?
0,0,0,My diagnosis is that you fear everyone you meet is going to fall down.
0,0,0,It's OK...I'll consider that a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Tell me again about the nightmare where you wake up underwater and can't breathe.
0,0,0,Let's talk about the split
0,0,0,How did you peel after our last session?
0,0,0,Freudian slip -- not fruitian.
0,0,0,I don't know, Doc...I just don't feel I'm appealing.
0,0,0,I think you may be suffering from peel envy.
0,0,0,Tell me more about you and your partner's split?
0,0,0,There better not be a banana in my tailpipe.
0,0,0,You had a refrigerator for a mother...
0,0,0,... and you've felt this way ever since you lost one of your four skins?
0,0,0,So, he gave you the "slip", huh? The dirty plantain.
0,0,0,When did you first realize that you enjoyed hurting people?
0,0,0,Do others often lay blame on you for their slip ups?
0,0,0,And why don't you think people take you seriously?
0,0,0,Please, tell me how you peel.
0,0,0,So your dad split when you pretty young, huh?
0,0,0,So that is when you started to lose your grip?
0,0,0,It seems that you have finally moved past your phallic stage.
0,0,0,I've lost my inner self!
0,0,0,Things were going great until she split!
0,0,0,So when did your fantasy about being stepped on by Hillary Clinton start?
0,0,0,Zip it up, buster.
0,0,0,I've just never found psychotherapy very appealing.
0,0,0,"I constantly feel rejected".
0,0,0,As we peel back the layers let me know how you feel.
0,0,0,Yes i hear you please tell me why you want to go naked in public.
0,0,0,So, how does it feel to fall for someone else?
0,0,0,Explain to me why you feel people look at you as slippery and that you have no appeal.
0,0,0,Do you see now, that its not your fault they slipped?
0,0,0,Hmm, I'm getting the impression that you feel discarded and stepped on.
0,0,0,Once you accept the fact your a discard, you can move on.
0,0,0,You understand that the falls, the slapstick...that's not you.
0,0,0,You feel in your heart your a watermelon, is that it?
0,0,0,Do you want to remain split with him?
0,0,0,I can help you with your inferiority complex but I can't do much about what they call your country.
0,0,0,Your self-destruction stems from co-dependence with the chimp.
0,0,0,Who and what am I?
0,0,0,Evasive, misleading, deceptive ... it doesn't matter how you describe it, the fact is you've been acting slippery lately
0,0,0,You talkin' to me?
0,0,0,I find you very apealing.
0,0,0,Would you prefer women didn't find you appealing?
0,0,0,Yes, I understand your appeal.
0,0,0,So, tell me more, about your ice cream sundae fantasy.
0,0,0,I'm going to certify you bananas.
0,0,0,Please turn over. You're spotting the couch.
0,0,0,The banana peel is challenged.
0,0,0,You need to stop suppressing your desire to stand out from the bunch.
0,0,0,Why do you think you give people the slip?
0,0,0,Well, yes, his new girlfriend is young, but remember, you have inner beauty.
0,0,0,Lately i've just felt empty inside...
0,0,0,And that's when I realised it was over between my Mother and me, I mean my lover and me...sorry - Freudian slip...
0,0,0,Another Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Now that you've calmed down I'll change you back.
0,0,0,So, in your mind, some part of you is still trying to appeal to your father.
0,0,0,Sometimes, Mr. Mini, as Freud said, a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,I've felt empty ever since the split.
0,0,0,Sometimes I think my wife is a hat.
0,0,0,So, my next slip off the wagon was when I was 19.
0,0,0,It's very difficult to communicate with you when you turn your back to me.
0,0,0,They blame me but it's Freudian...
0,0,0,I found the inner you to be delicious.
0,0,0,But ask yourself: Are all these ladies falling for you? Or, are they simply falling?
0,0,0,I understand that you feel used. It's a symptom of your split personality.
0,0,0,And you say people walk all over you, despite your appeal?
0,0,0,So, you think others find you not a peeling?
0,0,0,I am not getting paid enough for this.....
0,0,0,Well, you may think it was a slip, but I think it was a relapse.
0,0,0,I'm sure it was just a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I think we need to get you into a ‘0’ step program.
0,0,0,I feel like people just walk all over me.
0,0,0,So let me get this straight, YOU'RE the victim of all those slip and falls?
0,0,0,Having a fear of being without a peel is not a slip of the tongue.
0,0,0,So you feel that the split was a result of your yellowing complexion...
0,0,0,Your banana, split?
0,0,0,I feel like these days I'm so bruised up as time goes on
0,0,0,So...I don't think I'm going to be able to make a court appeel.
0,0,0,I'm glad that you've opened up to me, but let's try to keep this impersonal.
0,0,0,Sorry--am I getting under your skin?
0,0,0,I know life can be slippery, but you can't allow it to trip you up.
0,0,0,Everything seemed to fall apart after the surgery.
0,0,0,Everybody started falling for me after I lost all the weight.
0,0,0,No, those slips aren't Freudian.
0,0,0,Do you have ANY idea what it's like to be stepped on by everyone and then get blamed for their problems?!? No. I didn't think so. By the way...nice shoes.
0,0,0,How does that make you feel when they call you "old school" ?
0,0,0,You misunderstand. I didn't say you're appealing, I said you're a peeling.
0,0,0,I feel guilty about the clown.
0,0,0,So, how do you fell after the split?
0,0,0,Well . . the apple didn't fall far from the tree either
0,0,0,I still think you have sex appeal...
0,0,0,Tell me how you feel about being eaten by a monkey?
0,0,0,Tell me more about how you feel like people walk all over you....
0,0,0,I get thrown away, stepped on, and cursed.......I should be happy why ?
0,0,0,Now were saying, you're a former maid?
0,0,0,Even for me, it's hard to believe you've tripped that many people.
0,0,0,They're not laughing at you. They're laughing at him.
0,0,0,Perhaps there really is no 'inner you.'
0,0,0,Can you describe these pratfalls in more detail?
0,0,0,It can certainly be a burden when people keep falling for you.
0,0,0,Why does nobody understand I am a plantain?
0,0,0,You likely would've had a better result with group therapy.
0,0,0,Good mental health is no accident.
0,0,0,Seems to me like that was a Freudian split.
0,0,0,I just feel like something's missing.
0,0,0,Doc, I'm really just not peeling like myself lately...
0,0,0,Some people say they have one foot on you like it's a bad thing?
0,0,0,So, you say no one finds you appealing? That's bananas.
0,0,0,So tell me, when did you first feel unappealing?
0,0,0,you're responsible for the slip, but not the fall.
0,0,0,She took all of me. I feel so empty inside.
0,0,0,I think you may be unclear about the meaning of a 'Freudian slip'
0,0,0,So how long since you split?
0,0,0,I would call it a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,You can't escape responsibility by calling it a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,When did you first realize you are an empty suit?
0,0,0,You want to do Shakespeare, but you are typecast. And how does that make you feel?
0,0,0,Let's talk more about your peelings…
0,0,0,Tell me about your last slip.
0,0,0,Hmmm...you feel used and abandoned.
0,0,0,Why do you feel people avoid you and when did you start peeling this way?
0,0,0,I sense you're feeling abandoned ...
0,0,0,Do you often make a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,There is more to life than slip and fall.
0,0,0,It's not your fault that he slipped and everyone laughed.
0,0,0,Lucky he's in his blind spot.
0,0,0,Yes, but you can't let "slippery" define who you are.
0,0,0,So it sounds as if you're starting to have second thoughts about the gender surgery?
0,0,0,Your guilt's understandable except for the clowns.
0,0,0,Is being a comedy staple so terrible ?
0,0,0,I used to get a million laughs, then along came attorneys
0,0,0,And when did this war injury occur?
0,0,0,People are simply more cautious now.
0,0,0,' I just feel so empty on the inside you know..'
0,0,0,I can sense your feelings of emptiness, but let's try to focus on your ability to make people laugh.
0,0,0,At what age did you discover you're a peel?
0,0,0,No, I didn't just fart. And, yes, I do own a Toyota. So what, you think you're so special? You think because you're friends with Josh you are better than me? I think you need to leave.
0,0,0,Yes, we have no banana. Sorry to disappoint you.
0,0,0,I always get blamed.
0,0,0,I had been doing very well, but lately I seem to be slipping up.
0,0,0,Tell me more about these feelings of abandonment.
0,0,0,Well, you're right. Sometimes a banana is just a banana, but.....
0,0,0,Clowns always leave the most amusing insights.
0,0,0,This session is going to cost you a whole bunch.
0,0,0,If I understand your phobia correctly, you have a fear of monkeys?
0,0,0,I understand that he fell, but it still doesn't count as a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Have you considered taking responsibility for your actions, having some skin in the game?
0,0,0,So you feel that people are going out of their way to avoid you.
0,0,0,And you're tired of getting blamed for all these accidents?
0,0,0,It's usually best to establish trust before opening up to someone.
0,0,0,Can you elaborate on your feelings of emptiness?
0,0,0,So tell me when you first felt like everything was slipping away?
0,0,0,So, can you tell me more about this split?
0,0,0,So, tell me more about these self-induced fears.
0,0,0,I see something has been eating you from inside
0,0,0,Tell me about your nana
0,0,0,They're not laughing at you. They're laughing BECAUSE of you.
0,0,0,When did you shed your inner self?
0,0,0,Tell me about your tree.
0,0,0,Which is the bigger issue: feeling dangerous or empty?
0,0,0,That's confidential. Banana is also my client.
0,0,0,Why do you feel ice cream shops are the cause of your split personality?
0,0,0,I'd expect that kind of remark from a cucumber.
0,0,0,I'm tired of being on the road all the time.
0,0,0,So I presume you need help with the recent split?
0,0,0,So the monkey ran away with the football?
0,0,0,I'm afraid your mental health insurance doesn't include slip-and-fall coverage.
0,0,0,I just think nobody finds me appealing.
0,0,0,So how long have you been feeling all empty inside?
0,0,0,I admit it. I slipped up.
0,0,0,Carmen Miranda! Carmen Miranda! Get over her!
0,0,0,Why don't you accept yourself more, than everyone will like you.
0,0,0,I also run a support group for abandoned rinds, shells, and pea pods.
0,0,0,They laugh at you because they fear you.
0,0,0,Life is driving me bananas.
0,0,0,Honestly, I don't know why I split !
0,0,0,I'm here because I feel empty and discarded.
0,0,0,So. Tell me more about this "sexual slippage," as you call it, between media representation of fantasy and your perceived objective reality.
0,0,0,No, Ted. You're not a piece of garbage.
0,0,0,Yes, but calling it a 'Freudian' slip seems a bit grandiose.
0,0,0,Ah, I hear you saying, you were in it just for the humor.
0,0,0,You're right, it is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I know it may not seem it now, but you are more than just these peelings.
0,0,0,So... after he fell for you how did you feel?
0,0,0,You need to make amends with your bunch
0,0,0,It wasn't a Freudian slip, it was just a regular slip.
0,0,0,Why do you feel its not easy being green?
0,0,0,Is this your way of saying you find me appealing?
0,0,0,You need to stop this monkey business before it's too late.
0,0,0,So your banana split to be with a bad banana with a...greasy black peel?
0,0,0,I feel empty inside, and its unapeeling.
0,0,0,Ah, I see. And how did that make you peel?
0,0,0,So, when did you first realize that you were an orange in a banana's body?"
0,0,0,As a banana, you must realize your limitations in a world dominated by people.
0,0,0,And when did you develop this irrational fear of apes?
0,0,0,Peel back the layers of denial, and what're we left with?
0,0,0,...and then my ex left me in the middle of the road.
0,0,0,Tell me how you feel about being peeled from the wrong end?
0,0,0,I told you before, a doctor patient relationship has to remain professional.
0,0,0,Is it possible you might be a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,I've just been feeling so empty lately...
0,0,0,It seems you have become just a shell of your former self
0,0,0,When we started you were green with envy, then you were yellow-bellied, and now this limp emptiness--I'm not sure you want to make progress.
0,0,0,No, you can't peel me!
0,0,0,How are you peeling? I mean...feeling?
0,0,0,Well, your appealing nature is even hard for me to resist, after all, you are easy to fall for.
0,0,0,Oh, I misunderstood. My receptionist said you were a *fried* plaintain.
0,0,0,It's like I have nothing more to contribute. I feel used, empty inside.
0,0,0,Yes, I find you appealing , your a real smoothie.
0,0,0,so...what did YOU slip on?
0,0,0,Most people go through life without slipping on me even once. So why does everyone treat me like I'm a piece of garbage?
0,0,0,No. I don't feel like slipping on your peel.
0,0,0,Talk to me about your nana issues.
0,0,0,Let's start by pealing back the years.
0,0,0,You can't blame yourself-he was only a rabbit.
0,0,0,What do you mean, you'll slip up one day too?
0,0,0,I think it's your appeal.
0,0,0,In retrospect, we should have discussed the 800 pound gorilla
0,0,0,Everyone loves a banana
0,0,0,It's natural to feel you've lost the best part of yourself in a split.
0,0,0,So, did you actually make a plan to dive into the compost?
0,0,0,Yes, I've heard that "Freudian slip" joke before...
0,0,0,You say they stepped all over you, how did you feel about that?
0,0,0,The feelings of losing your inner self are compensated by your appeal.
0,0,0,We know you're not peeling well,, now let's find out why.
0,0,0,This really won't cure your phallicism."
0,0,0,I love the effort, but in our last session I said we were going to explore how you FEEL.
0,0,0,No....at worst you're a mere enabler.
0,0,0,You've got to rid yourself of the illusion that everyone is always falling for you.
0,0,0,you must learn to not blame yourself for the death.
0,0,0,Now, perhaps, we can get in touch with your feminine side.
0,0,0,I'm sorry, I slipped up.
0,0,0,I think most of your issues can be traced back to when your parents split.
0,0,0,I can tell you are just crushed on the inside aren't you.
0,0,0,Looks like you've already peeled back the layers.
0,0,0,I see what you're doing! Peeling me with your eyes.
0,0,0,How do you banana peel about that?
0,0,0,Well, it will be tough to blame the issues on your parents since you were produced asexually.
0,0,0,It's always difficult when a banana splits after a long marriage.
0,0,0,I got 99 problems but appeal ain't one.
0,0,0,You can't blame yourself if someone slips on you. It's not your fault, if everyone throws you away.
0,0,0,When did you start pretending you were an octopus?.
0,0,0,You feel like everyone steps all over you?
0,0,0,Maybe it was a Freudian slip, but my envy turned to ate.
0,0,0,She keeps telling me I have a split personality.
0,0,0,Finally! Your split personality is fully revealed!
0,0,0,Can you describe your peelings?
0,0,0,So you think you have a split personality?
0,0,0,It looks like you are happy to see me.
0,0,0,It's not your fault. Is it important to you that it not be your fault?
0,0,0,So you feel stepped on, but everyone else thinks its funny...
0,0,0,So you think you lost your self confidence after being replaced by a zucchini?
0,0,0,Don't you ever try to slip up on me like that again!
0,0,0,It's okay to backslide every so often.
0,0,0,You're just a slip of a thing
0,0,0,I don't particularly enjoy being stepped on, but those belly-laughs I get are my only bliss.
0,0,0,When did this fear of slopes begin?
0,0,0,Don't let one slip eat you up inside.
0,0,0,Yes you really are appealing but as your doctor I'm going to just let that slip.
0,0,0,I can't help you - I thought you said you'd gone bananas, not that your banana's gone.
0,0,0,guilt guilt guilt Did you ever think of how many people didn't slip?
0,0,0,Poor parenting is getting pushed from the nest while you are still in the egg.
0,0,0,I don’t think the banana is coming back.
0,0,0,Actually I think we've made great progress.. Remember when you started coming in?
0,0,0,What shall we address first, split personality or your empty feeling?
0,0,0,Since the split, my life has been a total joke.
0,0,0,'With a hollow mind, we cannot have that close affection anymore, but I'll keep on treating you off that slippery compulsive behaviour'
0,0,0,I just feel so discarded and stepped on.
0,0,0,So your banana split you for a sundae?
0,0,0,And you were saying,"You have appeal". Or was that a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,So, things started coming apart after the split ?
0,0,0,When the husband claims his wife has daily pms and needs counseling but doesnt realize he's the one with the split personality.
0,0,0,I think you're starting down a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Things have been pretty rough ever since the split.
0,0,0,How do you feel about breaking his leg?
0,0,0,I don't know, how does a housewife eat a banana?
0,0,0,When did you first feel disconnected.
0,0,0,Your life isn't a joke.
0,0,0,Tell me how that makes you peel.
0,0,0,Your slip is showing.
0,0,0,So, how do you feel about that slip?
0,0,0,Peelings, nothing more than peelings....
0,0,0,We can forget about mom for a while, I've got a whole new bunch of issues
0,0,0,We both know there's no such thing as an accident.
0,0,0,Yeah, I got it. What's the punchline?
0,0,0,Why do you say you feel worthless?
0,0,0,Your split personality took me aback.
0,0,0,It's clear you have some abandonment issues.
0,0,0,No, I think you're appealing.
0,0,0,So you're saying that these feelings of unworthiness, of inadequacy, came just after you were named Top Banana?
0,0,0,You need to stop cereal dating.
0,0,0,Slippage is your problem. That's why you have no friends.
0,0,0,I'm tired of being the scapegoat.
0,0,0,It was traumatic. Nana never let us socialise with other bananas, and put a sign in the window. We called it Nana's Banana Ban Banner.
0,0,0,Are you ready to talk about your feelings of emptyness?
0,0,0,I'm afraid my diagnosis peels back nothing slipperier than a split personality.
0,0,0,Oh, Dear! I didn't mean "literally."
0,0,0,Do you often feel empty inside?
0,0,0,Last week you felt soft.
0,0,0,OK. You have a facade that you present to everyone. You are afraid that people will see you are empty inside. I think you would feel better if you just act. Slip out onto that sidewalk and make them laugh.
0,0,0,Passive aggression is still passive aggression!
0,0,0,Piecing together your issue, I highly doubt that plastic surgery would be the answer...
0,0,0,So, she told you to split?
0,0,0,You are afraid my of monkeys and have penis envy?
0,0,0,Do you believe Mario intentionally ran you over?
0,0,0,It's time you acknowledge the split.
0,0,0,You may have lost your inner self by trying to nourish others
0,0,0,Tell me why you think you lost your appeal.
0,0,0,They keep falling for you.... How does that make you feel?
0,0,0,Ever since the split, I feel like my insides have been eaten out.
0,0,0,Stop staring at my legs!
0,0,0,You must stop blaming yourself for their falls.
0,0,0,This is getting expensive, she split on me again!
0,0,0,...so you feel empty on the inside...like something very important is missing...
0,0,0,Your problems are a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Crazy crazy bo-bazy, banana-fana fo-fazy, fee-fy mo-mazy, crazy.
0,0,0,I'm so tired of people blaming me for their slip-ups.
0,0,0,Going bananas? It appears you've arrived.
0,0,0,Fine. And how do YOU peel?
0,0,0,Your sense that you lack appeal may be related to your feelings of emptiness inside.
0,0,0,Tell me more about these feelings of emptiness.
0,0,0,As Freud said, 'Sometimes it's just a banana....
0,0,0,Did you consider that someone else might get hurt when you threw yourself down on the sidewalk?
0,0,0,Oh, C'mon, this isn't about your mother.
0,0,0,Pedestrians should watch their step, so it's clearly not your fault!
0,0,0,You want to put your what into my what?!? You really are sick.
0,0,0,everyone thinks it's so funny to walk all over me and they never question how it might make ME feel...
0,0,0,I'm just curious, which fruit recommended me?
0,0,0,Tell me more about your feeling empty inside.
0,0,0,So why are you tired of playing second banana?
0,0,0,Lets get past the fact that you are garbage, and move on to relationships.
0,0,0,Of course, you didn't cause all those accidents.
0,0,0,But tell me, how do you really peel?
0,0,0,I think it all began with your father slipping away from you at such a young age.
0,0,0,Even Cruz blames me for his campaign having one foot in the grave.
0,0,0,This would be a lot more productive if you said something other than 'K'.
0,0,0,You think I'm crazy, don't you?
0,0,0,Your fragrance is overpowering.
0,0,0,I sense there's something missing in your life.
0,0,0,So you feel like an apple trapped in a banana's body?
0,0,0,You said opening up to me would become a slippery slope, but I had no idea.
0,0,0,I slipped up again doc
0,0,0,Steve Martin walked away from comedy, so why can't you?
0,0,0,Don't take it personally. Chickens have been funnier than banana peels for a long time.
0,0,0,I believe in Love too but not that kind.
0,0,0,So, what do you think about this...
0,0,0,"Why do feel the need to get back to the wild bunch?
0,0,0,He gave me the Freudian slip!
0,0,0,We can finish talking about your peelings next week; it's time for me to split.
0,0,0,Well, someone might slip on you and break their neck. So, you CAN still be relevant.
0,0,0,and then you slipped... i see, tell me more...
0,0,0,This is a breakthrough. You finally opened up.
0,0,0,In the larger context of my life it was just a little slip.
0,0,0,Whether or not I find you appealing is hardly the point here...
0,0,0,I feel like I'm slipping in and out of reality.
0,0,0,I told you to stop monkeying around.
0,0,0,You're a banana peel. Of course people hate you. I hate you.
0,0,0,It appears that therapy has gotten under your skin.
0,0,0,You really take that whole., 'eat at my inner feelings' thing to heart, huh?
0,0,0,OK, you feel that "a certain something is missing". Can you elaborate?
0,0,0,It was a difficult split and I know you may never get over it, but I'm sorry to say that's how sundaes are made...
0,0,0,You think people are laughing at you?
0,0,0,I'm getting tired of these Freudian slips.
0,0,0,You don't feel whole anymore? Let's explore that.
0,0,0,So, you say you lost your inner self when you went bananas.
0,0,0,You have a banana split personality.
0,0,0,I feel like there's something missing.
0,0,0,I want to to break up with you Tom I have already ate you there is no point of a banana that has already been aten.
0,0,0,I suspect you are going bananas.
0,0,0,So why do you think your whole family is bananas?
0,0,0,So instead of being squashed you want to be the one who falls? You realize that poses another set of problems?
0,0,0,Look, you just need to understand that slip-ups happen and that you shouldn't be caught up in a bunch about it.
0,0,0,It was a joke, now I'm being sued for a slip and fall!
0,0,0,I said 'No!' But he just kept on peeling me." "What were you wearing?
0,0,0,So the banana split but you still have appeal.
0,0,0,Yes, you have no banana, no banana today. Yet, you must have hope and stop whining, for tomorrow morning you are going to the Big Bin to mingle and become one with other rotting Plant Life, to be reborn as Compost and bring sustenance to The Crops.
0,0,0,Diagnosis: split personality disorder.
0,0,0,After we peel back the layers, sometimes what we find is underwhelming.
0,0,0,And why do you feel you have lost your status as a phallic symbol?
0,0,0,We could plead life?
0,0,0,It's only natural that you'd have a persecution complex.
0,0,0,I'm afraid you have a split personality
0,0,0,I can assure you, the recurring dream of being stepped on is no joke.
0,0,0,Now that my appearance has changed...I don't know which bathroom to use ?
0,0,0,Today I'd like to focus on your feelings of abandonment.
0,0,0,So when he left, you thought he meant banana split?
0,0,0,You may be experiencing split personality.
0,0,0,You say you are bringing everyone around you down?
0,0,0,Would you say you've grown a thicker skin after the split?
0,0,0,People keep stepping on me like it's a joke.
0,0,0,I'm sorry, 'it's what's inside that counts' is just a saying
0,0,0,This is progress. You've learned how to express your peelings.
0,0,0,Well, we can all agree that you aren't completely bananas.
0,0,0,Banane, there was no need to strip for this session.
0,0,0,Maybe subconsciously I wanted him to slip and fall.
0,0,0,The monkey nightmares are back.
0,0,0,Don't tell me...you are slipping back again.
0,0,0,You blame yourself for everyone else's slip ups.
0,0,0,I don't think you need a psychiatrist to find your inner self, you'll need a detective.
0,0,0,Close your eyes and imagine you're on a tropical island...
0,0,0,You shouldn't feel inferior. You have lots of ap-peel.
0,0,0,Can you believe that my last therapist had the nerve to accuse me of being slippery?
0,0,0,Your insecurity is certainly not due lack of appeal.
0,0,0,You feel I slipped when peeling back your layers?
0,0,0,Is it the Freudian slips or brown spots that make you peel more appallingly?
0,0,0,Do you think your need to joke about "Freudian slips" may be masking something deeper?
0,0,0,Now, about this feeling that you're tripping up everyone ...
0,0,0,'I'm falling for you'
0,0,0,Nothing personal, buy you're heading down a slippery slope.
0,0,0,"Tell me more about this 'slippery slope'".
0,0,0,So it sounds like your constant worry of being tread on in life has lead to your depression...How do you feel about that?
0,0,0,And so then the banana split?
0,0,0,How long have you had this feeling of emptiness?
0,0,0,When did you first noticed you were being stalked by monkeys?
0,0,0,I've lost touch with my inner banana.
0,0,0,One little slip, and now my life is ruined!
0,0,0,I have another client, a pie, that I'd like you to meet.
0,0,0,Of course you're polymorph perverse
0,0,0,Well, I think this was a very fruitful session.
0,0,0,You need to stop blaming yourself for that Freudian slip.
0,0,0,But you ARE empty inside.
0,0,0,Let's talk about why you feel so empty inside.
0,0,0,I'm sure that was a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Tell me more about your mother's split personality.
0,0,0,While I also find you appealing, we must keep this professional.
0,0,0,...of course, most narcissists describe themselves as appealing.
0,0,0,Have you considered joining a compost heap?
0,0,0,And just why do you not feel part of the bunch anymore?
0,0,0,You lost a part of yourself that day, so it's not uncommon to still feel bruised from the experience.
0,0,0,Don't blame yourself; it was probably what we like to call a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,okay Chaquita what have you come to say?
0,0,0,"When did you decide you wanted to be a plaintain"?
0,0,0,Whoah...when I said you need to open up more I didn't mean like this!
0,0,0,What I think isn't important. Do you think you're an accident waiting to happen?
0,0,0,It's always what's on the outside that matters.
0,0,0,Separation anxiety is a perfectly normal reaction.
0,0,0,No, you shouldn't feel any sense of inferiority being the frontrunner's backup hairdo.
0,0,0,I'm a poor hunter, but at least I'm not reading a pretentious magazine.
0,0,0,So what unpeeled you this time?
0,0,0,Do you feel you're a danger to yourself or others?
0,0,0,Tell me what you mean by, "I feel like I've been slipping lately."
0,0,0,I'm sorry, this session is not covered by Obamacare
0,0,0,You're safe here. But don't get up just yet.
0,0,0,Your payments are on a sliding scale.
0,0,0,Opening up...finally.
0,0,0,I was the top banana before I slipped...could I lie on the floor I'm more comfortable there.
0,0,0,Do you feel guilty about making so many others slip up?
0,0,0,I feel like there's a part of me missing
0,0,0,We analysts refer to peeling the onion. Not the banana !
0,0,0,Cognitive slippage..couch slippage...whatever? I have a nail appointment.
0,0,0,I SEE YOU ARE SHORT SIGHTED AND SMALL MINDED
0,0,0,I may not look like Freud, but I know a Freudian slip when I see one.
0,0,0,You feel that you hurt everything you touch.
0,0,0,When did you realize you were starting to slip?
0,0,0,Once you go black, you can never go back.
0,0,0,Well, recently I've had this empty feeling.
0,0,0,Why would you think you don't have a peel?
0,0,0,Someone will fall for you eventually
0,0,0,It may sound bananas, but we need to make a fruitful appeal to your split personalities.
0,0,0,Many kids grow up fine in families without social standing or appeal.
0,0,0,Tell me; why do you feel discarded?
0,0,0,Yeah, I get it Mr. Dole, 'spilt' personalities are 'apeeling'. Clever. Now can we talk more about what the health teacher did to you?
0,0,0,Now you're independent.
0,0,0,We'll, if we go down that road, we're on that slippery slope you always end up on!
0,0,0,You seem to be suffering from separation anxiety.
0,0,0,Pardon my Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I'm too thin-skinned.
0,0,0,Yes, I find you appealing, but you know it's unethical of me to say so.
0,0,0,And this feeling started after you were separated from your family?
0,0,0,No I would NOT like to slip into something more comfortable.
0,0,0,Is this your 'ego' talking, or is it just your squid 'id'?
0,0,0,Yes, you're involved. But guilty for those blunders? Let's talk!
0,0,0,...and you still blame yourself for his injury? Let's see if we can't peel back another layer.
0,0,0,Seems like all that clown ever wants to do is step all over me.
0,0,0,Transfruit Identity Crisis: "Am I just a lazzi biding my time or a mere Freudian slip waiting to happen?"
0,0,0,Do you realize how much of your inner being you have lost?
0,0,0,Your inner self was soft and fragrant. Tell me more about your exterior. Is it...slippery?
0,0,0,I have an obsession that I will cause an accident
0,0,0,I hate it when they use the bathroom and snack during sessions!
0,0,0,And have you thought about reaching out to that snooty waiter with the full tray?
0,0,0,Let's work through your guilt feelings about the fall.
0,0,0,So you're now feeling like the second banana ?
0,0,0,Relationships can be slippery.
0,0,0,How long ago did you notice that you went bananas?
0,0,0,Don't tell me you've slipped again
0,0,0,But I feel like a vegetable.
0,0,0,This separation is making me feel like garbage.
0,0,0,Oh... that's not normally what is meant when you say your wife wanted to split.
0,0,0,It wasn't your fault-she slipped and fell!
0,0,0,No, I mean you are a pealing - literally.
0,0,0,.... regardless - I don't date patients.
0,0,0,That was a Freudian split.
0,0,0,You need to find your inner self.
0,0,0,Mhm. Classic signs of an Edible Complex.
0,0,0,I think, on some level, I like being stepped on.
0,0,0,tell me more about this serial killer
0,0,0,You can choose to focus on what you've lost, or you can focus on the happiness you've brought to others.
0,0,0,Let's not let our time slip away again.
0,0,0,It wasn't your fault. It was a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,You say you're feeling empty inside?
0,0,0,So, you say people are always slipping up around you?
0,0,0,So now you feel like the one slipping?
0,0,0,So you think you and nuts have both been stereotyped?
0,0,0,Feeling "stepped-on" is common, but aren't you being a bit dramatic?
0,0,0,So you feel guilty about causing thousands of people to slip and to fly through the air and land on their backsides.
0,0,0,Don't let your fear of being eaten destroy the happiness of today.
0,0,0,Sounds like you have a split personality.
0,0,0,I understand that he fell, but I really think you're missing what 'Freudian' means.
0,0,0,Emotionally, this is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,It would be unethical for me to acknowledge your appeal.
0,0,0,You shouldn't keep blaming yourself for other people's slips.
0,0,0,Often, the transition from fruit to lumpin peel generates feelings of great loss.
0,0,0,You need to stop punishing yourself for causing her downfall.
0,0,0,Tell me about the first time you felt like your life was a joke.
0,0,0,So tell me, what makes you think you have split personality disorder?
0,0,0,Tell me more about how you feel empty inside....
0,0,0,When did you first start having these hallucinations?
0,0,0,How long have you had this feeling that you must peel your skin?
0,0,0,But how did it FEEL when she stepped on you?
0,0,0,Your appeal is slipping? How does that make you feel?
0,0,0,Why do you blame yourself for other people’s slip-ups?
0,0,0,Now that I've eaten your inner self, I suppose there's not much left to discuss...
0,0,0,So, I see you've kept letting the wolves out there eat you for lunch.
0,0,0,Please tell me more about your family tree.
0,0,0,Was that a Freudian slip just now?
0,0,0,Where did I slip up, Doc?
0,0,0,And how did it make you feel when he treated you like discarded trash?
0,0,0,You have to move past this. People slip on things all the time.
0,0,0,Where was your Republic located
0,0,0,You are not only slippery, but truly evil, and should consider a career in politics ASAP!
0,0,0,I get no respect. One slip and fall and they never let you forget it.
0,0,0,You seem to be searching for your inner self.
0,0,0,We don't use the term "split personality" any more.
0,0,0,You are my first client that actually was able to transform peeling back layers of memories into a physical state that works out realistically and metaphorically.
0,0,0,Do you think everyone finds you appealing?
0,0,0,From what I understand from past meetings, I would say that your inability to maintain a meaningful business relationship is related to you tripping your partners up at crucial moments
0,0,0,Do you often have these urges to expose yourself?
0,0,0,I'm suffering from a guilt complex.
0,0,0,It's no wonder your mind was in the gutter...
0,0,0,When did you first learn you weren't organic?
0,0,0,Why do YOU think all your friends are all slipping away?
0,0,0,Yes, I can treat you for an irrational fear of hurting someone.
0,0,0,I understand you were used to being the "big banana" but your aren't organic.
0,0,0,And you've been involved in how many of these accidents?
0,0,0,So what makes you think every cute guy is going to just fall over you?
0,0,0,Is it wrong that I find you appealing?
0,0,0,You need to stop blaming yourself for others' slip-ups.
0,0,0,When did you two split?
0,0,0,Don't be a schlemiel, peel. Next time move out of the way!
0,0,0,If I accept your premise that you are a monkey trapped in a man's body, will you get off the ceiling fan?
0,0,0,A hazard to anyone who encounters you? Don't you think that's a little theatrical?
0,0,0,Let's try something you may find more appealing.
0,0,0,My diagnosis is that you have a split personality.
0,0,0,Looking back, being neglected when I was young and green wasn't such a bad thing after all...
0,0,0,Yes, your banana has left you. Yes, you will get spots and rot. Yes, you may cause a senior citizen to slip and break their hip. But eventually, you're going to the Big Landfill where you will be rejoined with a Bunch. Have hope. You are not alone.
0,0,0,The good news is that we've identified your objet (petit) a...
0,0,0,I understand you feel disconnected from your inner core.
0,0,0,Nooo! He's building a wall in Mexico Chiquita!
0,0,0,Why do you think you are always in a split?
0,0,0,I see. We'll try to help you not laugh about pratfalls.
0,0,0,I thought you would be more appealing in my skin than in yours.
0,0,0,The accident wasn't your fault.
0,0,0,No, I don't have a fear of slipping in heels. I sit like this for all my clients. Really. Now let's talk about you.
0,0,0,I understand you want your father back, but he slipped someone. That's a first degree felony
0,0,0,This is a peel to your imagination.
0,0,0,Not everyone can be top banana.
0,0,0,You say you feel Kafkaesque?
0,0,0,...again with the Freudian slips.
0,0,0,I would say you're ripe for analysis.
0,0,0,You shouldn't blame yourself, the accident sounds like it was caused by a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,You have a split personality.
0,0,0,I used to be top banana, but some monkey took care of that!
0,0,0,Are you familiar with the term "Freudian slip"?
0,0,0,So tell me - when did you split?
0,0,0,You feel unjustly neglected in the history of the Freudian Slip. Tell me more.
0,0,0,When did you first start believing you were actually a plantain?
0,0,0,When did you begin feeling others slipping up on you?
0,0,0,So, you find yourself over appealing? I can see why your wife says she can't talk to you.
0,0,0,Let's re-visit your cereal and milk obsession.
0,0,0,Thinking like that is a flippery slope, my friend!
0,0,0,I feel you've lost touch with your inner self.
0,0,0,Let's begin with your Herbaceous phase.
0,0,0,Describe your feelings after she slipped and fell.
0,0,0,No! Not even if you had a bone.
0,0,0,I've poured my insides out to you.
0,0,0,It seems you still exhibit hostility about your childhood on the plantation.
0,0,0,You shouldn't feel guilty just for making people laugh.
0,0,0,I'm no stranger to the transference game, Mr. Abernathy.
0,0,0,You're Freudian slip reveals that like your father you find the idea of splitting down to an island republic appealing.
0,0,0,Whew. Is it hot in here?
0,0,0,It sounds like we're dealing with a classic Edible complex.
0,0,0,I'm just the shell of what I used to be.
0,0,0,Counselor: "So you're saying you were attacked by banana poachers?" Banana peal: " Yeah, those merciless jackals! They take the banana and leave the peal. I can never go back to the jungle like this!"
0,0,0,What caused you to slip?
0,0,0,You seem to have a split personality.
0,0,0,Yes, throwing yourself on the floor as someone walks by, is a form of co-dependence.
0,0,0,It sounds like a classic Freudian slip.
0,0,0,'Seems to me you're just not comfortable in your own skin.'
0,0,0,I don't know - somehow I feel as if things are just slipping away.
0,0,0,Did you have any issues on the tree?
0,0,0,No I won't let you crawl under my shoe.
0,0,0,So tell me how the split has affected you..
0,0,0,why do you feel you are not appealing
0,0,0,At this point you're just repeating yourself
0,0,0,Turnover a new leaf. Wake up and smell the roses.
0,0,0,So you lost your entire family to vegans?
0,0,0,A clear case of tentacle-envy.
0,0,0,Yes, it's true, life is short. But then, so are you.
0,0,0,Do you feel that going out with such an ape has left you empty?
0,0,0,I think it all started when my parents split
0,0,0,The folks in my comedy group complain, say I’ve gone bananas. But, Doc, there are only so many times one can bear to be stepped on.
0,0,0,It's because I was discarded that made me hurt other people.
0,0,0,You're depressed because no one finds you appealing?
0,0,0,And how long have you had this feeling of everyone wanting you to be stepped on?
0,0,0,How did you feel when he slipped?
0,0,0,You say you feel empty inside. Why do you think that is?
0,0,0,You pay on a sliding scale.
0,0,0,Are you a banana, or are you happy to see me?
0,0,0,Did you say, 'squeeze me?'
0,0,0,Have you nothing left to cover?
0,0,0,Do you think you’re doing anything to contribute to this problem?
0,0,0,It feels like life is just slipping by.
0,0,0,No one ever finds me appeeling enough. It's always orange, orange, orange.
0,0,0,So you're saying you have regrets about having a relationship with someone less evolved.
0,0,0,You mustn't feel as if you're alone. I have a whole bunch of clients like you.
0,0,0,It's not at all unusual for peels to have banana envy.
0,0,0,Why do you feel like everything is slipping away?
0,0,0,Okay...let's talk about Bobo.
0,0,0,Do you have an idea about why it keeps happening?
0,0,0,Just to be clear. When you say "then she split", you do mean left you ?
0,0,0,She slipped on you! Do you blame yourself?
0,0,0,Let's talk about the bruises.
0,0,0,Don't look at my legs and I won't look at your skin.
0,0,0,Is that when you started bruising yourself?
0,0,0,So you've been having a hard time since the split?
0,0,0,Well, do you think that you're a tired, old joke?
0,0,0,My wife and I just split up
0,0,0,So could it be that your lack of sex appeal as a sexless peel keeps slipping you up in relationships once someone falls for you?
0,0,0,It sounds like you are realizing that drugs, sex and money will not fill the void.
0,0,0,When did you begin to notice those around you slipping?
0,0,0,Tell me more about your transition out of comedy.
0,0,0,You're experiencing survivor's guilt.
0,0,0,I already told you my approach is Jungian.
0,0,0,Well, I'm glad you've opened up.
0,0,0,No need for guilt. ..After all, what were the odds???
0,0,0,Tell me more about feeling discarded.
0,0,0,No one would be falling all over you if you weren't so slippery.
0,0,0,When did you first split up?
0,0,0,Note to self: this one is completely bananas.
0,0,0,So tell me how the split affected your childhood.
0,0,0,You said you've been feeling empty?" "It hurt so badly when she left. All because she said I had nothing but sex a-peel.
0,0,0,There's something slippery about your answers today.
0,0,0,Once again Harold, clothes don't make the man.
0,0,0,I said you are a peel. I did not say you have appeal.
0,0,0,Tell me again about your mango envy
0,0,0,To be honest, you are empty inside.
0,0,0,I find you very appealing also.
0,0,0,It is sad you lost Grandma, but there are millions of other Nanas out there.
0,0,0,Well, I'm prescribing Viagra.
0,0,0,It's perfectly normal to be upset. No one in your condition would want to be called a plantain.
0,0,0,But, Doctor, I still can't stop thinking of you as my first husband ...
0,0,0,So, you decided to peel away from the bunch and accept blame for the slips of others.
0,0,0,It's called an Oedipeel complex.
0,0,0,And just like that, you split?
0,0,0,You'll just have to come to terms with your role as comic relief.
0,0,0,And what are your views on female politicians?
0,0,0,Success is not measured by the number of people you bring down.
0,0,0,So being the top banana slipped away,....get over it!
0,0,0,Whether he comes back for this or not, the world is surely going to devour him.
0,0,0,Is this some sort of joke?
0,0,0,My mother took me to a zoo once; I haven't been the same since.
0,0,0,That plum job can still be yours.
0,0,0,It is natural to feel like garbage after being fired. But on the positive side, being a rainmaker for a slip and fall lawyer is not exactly honorable work.
0,0,0,Pratfall dependency is more common than you think.
0,0,0,You can blame your parents all you want but I still believe those bruises are natural.
0,0,0,But why assume they're laughing at you?
0,0,0,So what makes you think you're not appealing?
0,0,0,And how does giving them the slip make you feel?
0,0,0,"How do you feel about growing up in garden in the United States and not a garden in South America"??
0,0,0,Still feeling empty inside?
0,0,0,I feel like everyone is avoiding me.
0,0,0,When did you first feel you were a zucchini?
0,0,0,I thought you got your slip already.
0,0,0,Well, I see there is no point in discussing your inner feelings today.
0,0,0,If I have such appeal why is everyone avoiding me!?
0,0,0,I only accept Apple Pay.
0,0,0,I've come to say - I can't handle it anymore - I just can not watch another teacher go flying out the door!
0,0,0,Yes, I know a cigar is just a cigar.
0,0,0,Maybe it's just transference, but I find you appealing, too.
0,0,0,No. I was about to suggest "schadenfreude" not "schizoid".
0,0,0,Yes, what's inside is what matters most. That's why I ate it.
0,0,0,Perhaps you could channel your destructive tendencies into a YouTube prank show.
0,0,0,So is what I hear you saying is that you feel like a rotting slippery empty shell?
0,0,0,I personally know many not well hung who benefit from viagra...
0,0,0,Tell me why you feel like a punchline.
0,0,0,What you're feeling is classic survivor's guilt.
0,0,0,One more Freudian slip joke and this session is over.
0,0,0,It's quite normal to want to pollinate the therapist.
0,0,0,The wrong people just keep falling for me.
0,0,0,Sometimes I just slip into my emotions Doc...
0,0,0,How are you doing post-split?
0,0,0,So, when did this fear of people stepping on you begin?
0,0,0,You feel empty inside? I can empathize; so did I about 15 minutes ago.
0,0,0,I just want to establish some background on what has happened to your inner feelings before we begin.
0,0,0,I think it's split personality disorder.
0,0,0,No one said life is a bowl of bananas.
0,0,0,What things in your life do find unapPEELing?
0,0,0,When did you first feel like your life was just slipping away?
0,0,0,A Freudian slip you say...
0,0,0,I don't think that's what your ex meant when she said you didn't have appeal.
0,0,0,What makes you think that you are not appealing?
0,0,0,First it was 'you fruitcake!' and now it is 'you, fruit!!'.
0,0,0,So approximately how long have you felt this emptiness?
0,0,0,The world is slipping away from me
0,0,0,No, you're definitely not a nutcase.
0,0,0,Tell me more about your fear of being typecast.
0,0,0,And instead of taking me to the compost, this putz had the nerve to dump me in the trash, like I'm garbage or something.
0,0,0,What you're dealing with is survivor guilt... but trust me, Luigi will race again, even without Mario.
0,0,0,You're a natural self-saboteur...
0,0,0,You slipped up ... Who? How? Why?
0,0,0,My first approach would be to assure you that your ancestors are not responsible for Dr. Freud's theory.
0,0,0,Tell me more about how you were picked on and called the "fat fruit."
0,0,0,You don't need a therapist; you need a good attorney.
0,0,0,And then, I just got up and split.
0,0,0,Why do you feel you have no purpose?
0,0,0,I understand you identify as a vegetable. Only progressive grocery stores will you keep separate from the other fruits.
0,0,0,How long have you felt this rotten?
0,0,0,No, a fear of clowns is really very common.
0,0,0,Do you feel empty in your own skin?
0,0,0,Have you thought about getting some new material?
0,0,0,Well, is it possible that he never would have been comfortable in his own skin?
0,0,0,And how does that make you feel when people now think you're an orange knocking at their door?
0,0,0,Tell me more about this recurring dream. Did you feel responsible for the man carrying the cake falling? If so, what change in your behavior could have prevented his dropping your ex-wife's wedding cake? Go...
0,0,0,You've come out of your shell and have an antipasto phobia ?
0,0,0,What makes you think you're no loner appealing?
0,0,0,Do you think your problems stem from always feeling like a second banana?
0,0,0,Peeling away ... how did it feel .
0,0,0,Why did your lover treat you like a pratfall?
0,0,0,Where's the rest of the banana?
0,0,0,And, you say since the penectomy, you've been feeling empty inside?
0,0,0,Trump's rhetoric about imports concerns me too.
0,0,0,I know, it's a slippery slope.
0,0,0,So, how have you been doing since the split?
0,0,0,Your sarcastic tone is probably the reason people don’t find you “a peeling.”
0,0,0,All true, but, pratfalls aside, there are many positive aspects to your appeal.
0,0,0,Oh please! Not the old Freudian slip thing again!
0,0,0,So, when we left off, you were talking about the emptiness you feel and how life seems to be slipping away.
0,0,0,So...tell me again...why did you and your better half split?
0,0,0,And how does that make you feel, appealing?
0,0,0,You no longer have appeal?
0,0,0,How did you feel when you first realized she was a tarantula?
0,0,0,Yes, but have you considered that you wanted to make them slip?
0,0,0,Fruit, herb. What does it matter? Everyone loves you.
0,0,0,You weren't abandoned. You were picked.
0,0,0,So, you'd rather split than commit?
0,0,0,How long have you not been feeling like a star?
0,0,0,I've got potential!
0,0,0,Let's talk about your latest slip up.
0,0,0,You really feel you lack appeal???
0,0,0,Mr. Belknap, if brains were bones, you'd be a banana.
0,0,0,You are not appealing to me you are just a peel!
0,0,0,Explain to me why you feel empty and used.
0,0,0,How was your week?
0,0,0,That's a really slippery attitude.
0,0,0,What am I looking at here?
0,0,0,Don't have to take it so personally, your name just slipped my mind.
0,0,0,I keep dreaming that you need a big hit of potassium.
0,0,0,Dont feel bad, most of my patients are also bananas.
0,0,0,I don't know whether to laugh or cry!
0,0,0,What makes you think you're unappealing?
0,0,0,I used to be the top banana now everyone treats me like trash.
0,0,0,Don't worry. It's not unusual to feel useless at your stage in life.
0,0,0,Tripping people is what your people do.
0,0,0,Have you considered embracing, or even finding joy in, the slippery.
0,0,0,Yes, you have told me that your banana was really big
0,0,0,Going bananas? I'm sorry, I only see fruitcakes.
0,0,0,And when did you feel you were slipping?
0,0,0,No wonder you feel guilty again. How often have I insisted that you stay away from sidewalks?
0,0,0,How long have you felt disregarded?
0,0,0,Have you considered approaching Cialis Mr. Dole?
0,0,0,Banana Splits?, hmmm.
0,0,0,I would say you have a 'split personality'.
0,0,0,A man stepped on you...go on...
0,0,0,Diagonsis: Peel-nus Envy.
0,0,0,So your mother was rotten and your father split
0,0,0,Could you tell me more about how your family lost their bananas?
0,0,0,Everybody always blames ME for their slip-ups!!
0,0,0,So you're depressed because your banana split, is that correct?
0,0,0,Shall we explore why you're feeling "easily bruised"?
0,0,0,Tell me more about your edible arrangement phase.
0,0,0,Perhaps you should seek another therapist. Lately, I feel as though I'm slipping.
0,0,0,Is is possible not everyone shares your sense of humor?
0,0,0,His other foot could have been in Boca.
0,0,0,And why do you think you always act like a coward?
0,0,0,Cliché? You're going to whine to me about being cliché?
0,0,0,Ok.... So after being served with the slipping personal injury lawsuit, you say it's left you feeling a little yellow.
0,0,0,That's what is known as a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Tell me, how do you feel being used as a comedic device?...
0,0,0,Sometimes everyone feels like a joke.
0,0,0,You can't blame your wife for calling you 'slippery'."
0,0,0,You shouldn't feel guilty just because people slip on you.
0,0,0,Sometimes we all feel a little "used up and worthless"........
0,0,0,Based on our work here today, I'm recommending to the parole board that you're not yet ready to reenter society.
0,0,0,You have what we call 'banana envy.'
0,0,0,No, Freud never mentioned 'banana envy.'
0,0,0,How does it make you feel to be the source of so many Freudian slips?
0,0,0,'..and you blame yourself?'
0,0,0,And in these dreams, you say he's falling?
0,0,0,Yes, the outside is viewable but you're here for the hidden core
0,0,0,I don’t know, doc, I just feel all empty inside. It’s really affecting my sex life.
0,0,0,People keep getting tripped up with me.
0,0,0,And why do YOU think your always under foot?
0,0,0,You say she dumped you?
0,0,0,Most anyone in your position would feel like a discarded banana peel.
0,0,0,Banana fanna fo........sorry.
0,0,0,When he slipped and fell, how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,"Penicillin" that's what I suggest.
0,0,0,Plastic surgery just isn't an option for your condition, it would be fruitless.
0,0,0,I'm willing to make an exception and charge you on a sliding scale
0,0,0,So tell me more about this sense of emptiness you have been feeling.
0,0,0,Very clever, Mr. Carlton. No, I haven't seen your banana.
0,0,0,Oops! He left...
0,0,0,I think you should get in touch with your inner self.
0,0,0,Why do you feel you're life's one big joke?

0,0,0,Just remember, tragedy plus time equals comedy.
0,0,0,I definitely think your split personality, Mrs. B., stems from your chocolaholic husband desserting you.

0,0,0,I don't know why I peel this way .
0,0,0,I understand you feel empty, but you are appealing.

0,0,0,Would you feel more comfortable on a salad plare?

0,0,0,You're a banana for God's sake. People are supposed to use you up and then throw you away.
0,0,0,It's not rhetorical question.
0,0,0,So you're feeling used, just a shell of your former self?
0,0,0,Clarify for me, what you mean when you say you feel "all eaten up inside"?
0,0,0,Take a deep breath, and repeat to yourself "I'm more than a punchline, I'm more than a punchline".
0,0,0,Well, it all started when he slipped on me...
0,0,0,First you were eaten alive, and then spent years in slapstick? Of course you feel rotten.

0,0,0,These feelings of guilt, you say the person slipped while texting?
0,0,0,I'm just here to peel away at the edges of the story.
0,0,0,Perhaps you hurt others because you feel empty inside?

0,0,0,Exactly when and where did you slip up?
0,0,0,I still have a long way to goooooo...........
0,0,0,Where do you think this emptiness inside originates?
0,0,0,When did you first feel this emptiness?
0,0,0,Doctor, I haven't been feeling comfortable in my own skin lately.
0,0,0,My professional opinion is that you're giving me the 'slip'.
0,0,0,So, you're still feeling empty?
0,0,0,This guy you've been dating sounds like a real MONKEY!
0,0,0,We may have some trouble finding the root of your problem.
0,0,0,It's perfectly normal that you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,And how do you feel when people slip?
0,0,0,I feel so empty inside. This session has been fruitless.
0,0,0,Tell me about your slip-and-fall.
0,0,0,Slippery situation you have there.
0,0,0,Obviously, you aren't as excited to see me any more.
0,0,0,Tell me more about this emptiness you've been feeling.
0,0,0,Mr. B. it is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,We call it splitting....
0,0,0,I just seem to let people walk all over me.
0,0,0,It's not unusual for a patient to split when therapy becomes uncomfortable.
0,0,0,How do you expect to have any friends if you're always giving them the slip.
0,0,0,You're slapstick phobic?
0,0,0,I scream! You've deserted yourself!
0,0,0,You say you feel empty, like your insides have been eaten out and you're all alone, tossed out on the street. Can you elaborate?
0,0,0,How long have you felt that people treat you liked a used-up fruit?"
0,0,0,Now tell me how that made you peel?
0,0,0,My advice--move on....we can't all be top banana
0,0,0,This is not the slippery slope that you want to go down.
0,0,0,Let's revisit your relationship with your mother...the whipped cream, the red cherry. Sounds like a classic case of the Freudian Split.
0,0,0,So what's eating you this week?
0,0,0,Accidents happen; you aren't responsible for every slip and fall.
0,0,0,We're on a slippery slope here.
0,0,0,How do you think I peel?
0,0,0,Last week we talked about how self-actualization was driving you bananas...How's that going?
0,0,0,And that's why we split.
0,0,0,So, he used you, threw you away........o.k I get it ...then what happened?
0,0,0,i use to be part of a huge great bunch . but since my new owner selected me. i have become a one off munch ..
0,0,0,Yes...I'd say you probably have gone bananas
0,0,0,I'm afraid I'm not as appealing as I once was.
0,0,0,And just how long have you felt fruity?
0,0,0,It's really not your fault that people It must be hard for you now that Bernie is out of the race.
0,0,0,Tell me about your childhood, Chiquita
0,0,0,You need a Freudian analyst
0,0,0,And was it then that you went bananas?
0,0,0,Pardon my slip.
0,0,0,That's good. So how long have you had this empty feeling?
0,0,0,I think we can rule out a potassium deficiency.
0,0,0,So, you were once a large phallic symbol. But you gave that away for the starring role in a dessert flambé. Now, you are an empty shell and spend your days causing falls. Tell me, Mr. Peele, have you considered running for President?
0,0,0,Seriously, they don't see you're a peel?
0,0,0,Tell me why you don't feel appealing.
0,0,0,You feel empty,the monkey left you,your inner core was taken away!
0,0,0,That's what we call a Freudian slip
0,0,0,Why do you think that you continue to question whether to cause a slip or not to cause a slip?
0,0,0,I did warn you that we would peel back all the layers.
0,0,0,Do you feel you may be losing your sex appeal?
0,0,0,My dad was a real fudge-up. When I was ten, he split.
0,0,0,You say your father thinks you're a joke.
0,0,0,How did you feel when the fruit flies surrounded Sonny?
0,0,0,I think you need to stop that diet.
0,0,0,I feel like I'm just a shell of my former self, Doc.
0,0,0,If you weren't my therapist and I wasn't a banana, would you....
0,0,0,So Steve Jobs picked the apple instead, and it's been downhill for me ever since.
0,0,0,You can't blame yourself for every Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Since my wife split, I have a hard time feeling a-peeling.
0,0,0,So your not peeling very well.
0,0,0,There is no such thing as a 'Freudian Slip'. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar!
0,0,0,So, I guess making people slip was a way to get positive attention.
0,0,0,You appear to be suffering from a classic case of banandonment.
0,0,0,That's not what I meant when I said time to split.
0,0,0,Once again, why did yor date fall for you?
0,0,0,They put you where?
0,0,0,Monkey see, monkey do, banana go to therapy.
0,0,0,Nice slip
0,0,0,We'll spend the next few sessions on overcoming the Freudian slip.
0,0,0,And when someone does fall, how does that make you feel?
0,0,0,Describe your feelings when they accused you of acting like a star.
0,0,0,So, how did you feel when someone stepped on you, slipped and fell?
0,0,0,I don't think a banana can "go bananas".
0,0,0,Try to think outside the cartoon box!
0,0,0,How long have you felt like a joke?
0,0,0,Well, despite what you have been told, I think you are certainty a-peeling.
0,0,0,So you're depressed because you're not the top banana anymore?
0,0,0,So Mr. Dole, what do you mean by "going bananas"?
0,0,0,Sometimes a banana peel is just a banana peel.
0,0,0,I've always had trouble revealing myself to people.
0,0,0,I used to be young, ripe, and full of life, but now I feel like things are always slipping away from me.
0,0,0,I know she ate your insides out and then dropped you. Try to think about the future. You'll make some compost pile very happy.
0,0,0,I'm sorry, that was too forward. My split personality is definitely getting worse.
0,0,0,I've been doing it the wrong way my entire life.
0,0,0,Lately it seems like everyone is avoiding me.
0,0,0,Your mother was a soda jerk?
0,0,0,I can see why you feel nothing inside.
0,0,0,What you call toxic, Doc, I call obvious.
0,0,0,I'm sorry. It just came out that way.... that you really are just a cigar.
0,0,0,"Feelings of emptiness are common for someone in your position".
0,0,0,So you feel empty inside or like something is missing.
0,0,0,My life just seems fruitless!
0,0,0,Those Cialis commercials are wearing me out.
0,0,0,Will these bruises ever heal?
0,0,0,Sorry Mr. Cavendish, I don't usually eat my clients, but I skipped lunch.
0,0,0,So how did that make you feel when you got stepped on?
0,0,0,Transitioning into observational comedy is a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I mean, who's to say I'm not an apple?
0,0,0,You miss breeding fruit flies.
0,0,0,Calm down, this whole 'irony' fad will pass; slap-stick will be back and bigger than ever.
0,0,0,You say you find me appealing...
0,0,0,And sometimes a cigar is just a good smoke.
0,0,0,Let's talk about why you think you have a split personality.
0,0,0,Your issues are certainly appealing.
0,0,0,Would you say you're feeling hollow on the inside?
0,0,0,I understand, but sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,It sounds like you yearn for someone to fall for you, and fall hard.
0,0,0,Tell me more about this slip-up problem you've been having.
0,0,0,My personality was never aPEELing to a bunch!
0,0,0,All my friends seemed to have slipped away.
0,0,0,Schadenfreude and Masochist What can I say, I enjoy slapstick humor and being stepped on.
0,0,0,I feel like I got nothing left inside.
0,0,0,Why do you think you chose a therapist with high heels?
0,0,0,So why do you think people are always walking all over you?
0,0,0,How long have you been peeling this way?
0,0,0,What makes you think it was a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,I feel like I'm just a shell of my former self.
0,0,0,He's a slippery one
0,0,0,Yes, I guess you're appealing in an organic sort of way.
0,0,0,People think you're slippery, how does that make you feel?
0,0,0,Well, that's not exactly what Freudian slip means.
0,0,0,And how exactly did that make you peel?
0,0,0,Do you think they are laughing at you, or with you?
0,0,0,When they called you yellow..how did that make you peel?
0,0,0,No, you do not have split personality disorder
0,0,0,He said I'm no longer appealing.
0,0,0,It's much healthier not to take those slipping on a banana peel jokes personally.
0,0,0,Yes, I know you're happy to see me.
0,0,0,Not your fault. He should have looked where he was walking.
0,0,0,So you were in a bunch with the other bananas, a monkey came along, then what happened?
0,0,0,I’m afraid that spending yet another session focusing on your abandonment issues may prove fruitless.
0,0,0,So tell me, what did she do to you?
0,0,0,You've slipped since our last session.
0,0,0,I know how you peel.
0,0,0,Another slip up?
0,0,0,So, tell me when you first had the feeling people were avoiding you?
0,0,0,I feel like you never answer my question directly . . .
0,0,0,Tell me, when did you first feel this emptiness.
0,0,0,Tell me about when you first felt like a plantain.
0,0,0,How does it make you feel when others call you an accident waiting to happen?
0,0,0,And since when have you had this feeling of emptiness?
0,0,0,I'm waiting for the day someone slips on me and says, 'sorry, banana peel, I didn't notice you were rotting there.'
0,0,0,Of course others find you appealing.
0,0,0,And then the ice cream up and split.
0,0,0,Let's peel away and get to the fruit of your problem.
0,0,0,Yes, Mr. Cavendish, and how long has this "Fusarium wilt" nightmare been troubling you?
0,0,0,I just don't know, Doc. Feels like I'm going down a slippery slope.
0,0,0,So you finally fulfilled your fantasy about oral sex.
0,0,0,And what happened next?
0,0,0,So, you think you're the top banana and side-splittingly funny? You don't really think you can slip that by me, do you?
0,0,0,So you're saying, he's back in rehab and you feel like you're the slippery friend
0,0,0,Try not to think of it as another fruitless therapy session.
0,0,0,Explain what you mean by "slipped up."
0,0,0,I get it, you're not the top banana anymore.
0,0,0,Look, you've got to stop blaming yourself for what happened to Principal Barker. You were a pawn in Billy's game, nothing more.
0,0,0,It's hard for me to talk to psychologists. They always giggle when I say I feel empty inside.
0,0,0,Banana split personality IS a real diagnosis.
0,0,0,I can see why she fell for you.
0,0,0,So you split on a sundae, right?
0,0,0,Now, you say you've been experiencing a lot of slip ups lately?
0,0,0,What do you mean you have regressive illusions of becoming a starfish?
0,0,0,Talk some more about your feelings of people slipping away from you.
0,0,0,So, you don't feel like one of the bunch?
0,0,0,You're co-dependent.
0,0,0,It hurts on the inside.
0,0,0,You are saying you have a banana sized hole in your life you're trying to fill, go on...
0,0,0,So how do you feel about that particular monkey?
0,0,0,You are too yellow and too slippery for psychoanalysis: but I'm the Top Banana around here.
0,0,0,Yes, I make a lot of money talking to banana peels.
0,0,0,So, what made you think you might be becoming an ape?
0,0,0,I've really slipped up this time.
0,0,0,I feel empty, used up, cast aside. I may still have some appeal, but that's all I have.
0,0,0,What makes you believe you have a split personality?
0,0,0,Feel free to peel away your inner banana.
0,0,0,First dumped, then stepped on! I can't take it any more!
0,0,0,What was growing up like with a red mother and a plantain father?
0,0,0,Is that a banana peel on my couch? Or are you just glad to see me?
0,0,0,I'd like to discuss what happened at the zoo.
0,0,0,Still having that nightmare where everyone watches where they’re going?
0,0,0,After they ripped me apart, I felt so empty !
0,0,0,Well, I can understand why your ego might be bruised when you let a bunch of clowns walk all over you.
0,0,0,When did you get dumped by Apple?
0,0,0,So you feel you're losing appeal...
0,0,0,Number one, I need to get back to my professional code Number two, I think my boyfriend's on to us.
0,0,0,It doesn't matter what I think. Do YOU think your life has been one big joke?
0,0,0,So you're saying that it wasn't your decision to split?
0,0,0,I'm glad to see you finally open up.
0,0,0,We all feel unfulfilled at some point in our lives.
0,0,0,Let's focus on externalizing.
0,0,0,Tell me more about why you want him to feel hurt.
0,0,0,As your psychiatrist, I must warn you: You are on a "slippery slope."
0,0,0,Things have been really tough since the split.
0,0,0,Others I've treated have come out of tail pipes and are doing just fine.
0,0,0,So you want to talk about your mood swings?
0,0,0,They put you in the refrigerator? That's cold!
0,0,0,Perhaps it was actually a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I think I am going bananas
0,0,0,Yes it's painful now, but I promise one day we'll all just laugh.
0,0,0,Yes. There is more to life than just pratfalls.
0,0,0,Get over it! I'm a little bananas too after dealing with you guys all day.

0,0,0,Between the two of us, I feel we can get you pulled back together
0,0,0,Most of my pals have split too.
0,0,0,It sounds like a bunch of Freudian slips

0,0,0,You'll see that there is always more to peel away
0,0,0,Let's talk about your inner child.
0,0,0,Ther: why wont you sit in the other chair Patient: I didn't want to incase of a Freudian slip
0,0,0,Now, tell me why you and your wife split.

0,0,0,Okay, you're sessions up. Time to split.
0,0,0,I'm not clear on your reference to a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,The aftermath of a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,"Can we talk about this latest slip?
0,0,0,That's quite a litany of complaints: you feel cast aside, you smell rotten, you're yellow, and you feel responsible for people slipping and falling. I think you may suffer from situational anxiety.
0,0,0,Why am I always the fall guy?
0,0,0,You know, sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,What can I say, doc? I slipped up.
0,0,0,I think you should split custardy every sundae.
0,0,0,Tell me about your family tree.
0,0,0,I keep slipping through the main stream in society/
0,0,0,I told you to break a leg, not do it to the Oscar winning actor.
0,0,0,The same nightmare again, being eaten alive?
0,0,0,I mean, I just feel like the fall guy all the time.
0,0,0,So...you think your not appealing ?

0,0,0,So, you feel empty inside – live with it.
0,0,0,You've really gone bananas this time
0,0,0,Peel back the layers & tell me when it all started.
0,0,0,Any idea how many people come in here claiming to be the fall guy?
0,0,0,He left you. How does that make you peel?
0,0,0,You're comparing apples to oranges.
0,0,0,How many monkeys did you say there were?
0,0,0,You've got to stop seeing yourself as a second banana.
0,0,0,Well, it depends. Did you want to make her fall?
0,0,0,So you're saying that you feel used.
0,0,0,Maybe you're just bananas
0,0,0,Sometimes I feel it's all just slipping away.
0,0,0,Well THAT'S a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Don't feel guilty - you were stepped on!
0,0,0,50% of all bananas split.
0,0,0,Every day is just another accident waiting to happen.
0,0,0,Maybe you could start by explaining your appeal.
0,0,0,Yes, I stood on you, but it wasn't a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Don't feel guilty about the rise in insurance premiums in slip-and-fall accidents.
0,0,0,Um, so I have "a friend" who's in love with his therapist, he just thinks she might be a little crazy...
0,0,0,I think if we peel back your facade, we will find your authentic self.
0,0,0,When did you feel him slipping away from you?
0,0,0,And you say he stepped on you?
0,0,0,Sometimes a plantain, is just a plantain.
0,0,0,Comparing my childhood to my sister's is like apples and oranges, she said...
0,0,0,I'm afraid if I split, I'll just become another cliche

0,0,0,So, you think your slipping and something inside you is missing?
0,0,0,So, what would make you think that you have a split personality?
0,0,0,You seem to have lost your appeal.
0,0,0,So, you're telling me that being slippery is just in your nature...

0,0,0,I've noticed you often use the phrase, "I slipped up on that one." Why do you think you do that?
0,0,0,So, this "emptiness" started when the banana split?
0,0,0,When was the first time you felt "hollow inside?"

0,0,0,Banana envy?

0,0,0,The feelings of being empty inside started to go away after you suggested that perhaps I was born a different plant.
0,0,0,First, we need to peel away the outer layer.
0,0,0,Stop blaming yourself.
0,0,0,Well ... Yes, Freudians slip but they generally don't fall down.
0,0,0,Our time's up. Please slip on out the side door.
0,0,0,I am required to report those bruises.
0,0,0,Your lack of an inner-self appears to be the crux of the problem.
0,0,0,Tell me, what's been eating you up inside?
0,0,0,The first step in conquering inner emptiness is coming out from under the chaise.
0,0,0,And you say you’re tired of being walked on?
0,0,0,I can see that this experience has eviscerated you. But at the same time, you've gained balance.
0,0,0,Despite the anti-immigrant sentiment in the country, you must come to grips with the fact that your mother was a plantain.

0,0,0,I guess I never realized that you were skinned alive.

0,0,0,How did that make you feel, when they just threw you away like that?
0,0,0,Remember what Freud said: There are no accidents.

0,0,0,What's your secret for mastering the splits? It's very appealing.
0,0,0,You're a banana afraid of a tarantula? Where is it?!!
0,0,0,Just because you are slippery doesn't mean you have to try to "trip" me up!
0,0,0,For the last time, that's not what "Freudian slip" means.
0,0,0,Well no, that's not really what "Freudian slip" means...
0,0,0,To be so open . . . such a-peel!
0,0,0,Just because it's cliche doesn't mean it isn't painful.
0,0,0,'Gee, I would enjoy this banana even more if I didn't have to take off the peel,' said no one ever.
0,0,0,You are not alone: A split personality can drive anyone bananas.
0,0,0,Have you tried a potassium supplement?

0,0,0,I tend to trip people up. I guess that's why they don't like me.
0,0,0,Sometimes I feel like you're not all here.
0,0,0,Now then, tell me, do you remember when this feeling of total uselessness started?
0,0,0,So how does it make you feel to always be the butt of the joke...?
0,0,0,So what makes you think you aren't appealing?
0,0,0,What do you mean you bring people down?
0,0,0,I wasn't your fault. Accidents happen.
0,0,0,Doesn't it feel good to open up?
0,0,0,Tell me more about your fear of spectators.
0,0,0,I know it's what is on the inside that's important, but that doesn't make it hurt any less.
0,0,0,A Freudian slip has nothing to do with banana peels.
0,0,0,You're walking the slippery slope again, you know.
0,0,0,Tell me what led to the split.
0,0,0,I know it's not easy but you're comparing apples and oranges.
0,0,0,Have you considered that you really are all peel, no banana?
0,0,0,It seems you need others to fall to feel good about yourself.
0,0,0,whats wrong in your life?
0,0,0,So how does it make you feel when you cause people to slip up?
0,0,0,Well, sometimes I think we all feel empty inside...
0,0,0,Next time can you bring your other half?
0,0,0,And you say the witch doctor became angry ?
0,0,0,We call it a banana split personality disorder.
0,0,0,Feeling empty is only natural, but do try to stay off of sidewalks.
0,0,0,So, how long have you felt picked on?
0,0,0,What would you do if I wasn't here?
0,0,0,So Mr. Peal, when did these feelings of 'Goin' Bananas' begin?
0,0,0,Would you like to talk about your feeling of emptiness?
0,0,0,Other than an apple core and a peach pit, do you have any other personalities?
0,0,0,I am just trying to peel away some oyour problems.
0,0,0,I just don't understand why people always tell me that I lack a peel.
0,0,0,Superficial? Thin-skinned? Say more…
0,0,0,I don't find myself appeeling
0,0,0,People slip up. It can't always be your fault.
0,0,0,So the constant bickering is driving you...you?
0,0,0,Why are you using such slippery words?
0,0,0,Sorry, did you say you had a close relationship with your Nana?
0,0,0,I was doing so well and then I slipped.
0,0,0,So you feel you unconsciously willed him to fall?
0,0,0,Are you bannanas!?! I'm married!
0,0,0,So how does always getting stepped on make you feel?
0,0,0,Sometimes we overlook the simplest of explanations for our problems. The reason you feel so empty inside, Reginald, is that your father didn't show you affection as a child.
0,0,0,Just relax, Mr. Peel, and tell me what’s eating you.
0,0,0,You are suffering from P.T.S.D. You witnessed him being cut up and put into a cereal bowl.
0,0,0,I told you I was a witch, doctor -- what do you have to say now?
0,0,0,Sounds like a tough split but I'm sure you'll find another bunch to hang with
0,0,0,No one take me seriously, always the fall guy...makes me feel like a heel.
0,0,0,Don't blame the monkey.
0,0,0,Identity problem again?
0,0,0,I am going bananas.." ohh, you've slipped again?.
0,0,0,Interesting. You say a monkey has given you this empty feeling.
0,0,0,Let's discuss your Freudian slips.
0,0,0,And how are things going with your friends? Are you still hanging with the same bunch?
0,0,0,So your last psychologist diagnosed you with split personality disorder?
0,0,0,Yes, you are a fruit. Deal with it.
0,0,0,I’d rather slip on something other than you.
0,0,0,No, "Banana Split" is not a condition listed in the DSM.
0,0,0,When did you begin to feel life had passed you by?
0,0,0,I made like a banana.
0,0,0,I believe you are suffering from ecdysiatimism. But don't worry, it got me through medical school.
0,0,0,Look, it's a slippery slope, but we can go there if you need to...
0,0,0,I was spoiled rotten as a kid. Now I have no backbone.
0,0,0,Too bad it's not in his hand.
0,0,0,I dunno...I just feel empty all the time.
0,0,0,Your suggestion that this endeavor is fruitless could be interpreted as a projection.
0,0,0,So you are saying you were a man before, right?
0,0,0,And then...he gave me the slip !
0,0,0,I was minding my own business, and he slipped on me, yet everyone ran to him to see if HE was OK.
0,0,0,Do you want a Freudian interpretation?
0,0,0,Let's talk about the monkey incident.
0,0,0,Peeling away the layers to get at the truth.. forgive me. It's just an expression we use.
0,0,0,So, you think I'm appealing, too?
0,0,0,Your mood issues might be caused by a potassium deficiency.
0,0,0,I empathize with your feelings about the jokes of slipping on you and having "appeal", but isn't true that you ARE yellow?
0,0,0,Stop blaming yourself. You didn't mean for that man to slip.
0,0,0,That's a very slippery slope!
0,0,0,If you think that I will fall for this trick, you are nuts.
0,0,0,Life is fruitless.
0,0,0,You know, not every slip is a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,You said you are not a peeling?
0,0,0,Tell me why you don't like being called appealing?
0,0,0,So you feel empty, being replaced by the big cheese?
0,0,0,No . . . I don’t think it was a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,So how long have you felt you're a public menace?
0,0,0,It sounds to me like cucumber envy.
0,0,0,So when did you start your fear of analysts, Mr. Bonzo..., Mr. Bonzo?
0,0,0,I don't know what to raise first, that you're completely bananas or the Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Let's talk more about your split personality.
0,0,0,Tell me more about that dream where Freud steps on you...
0,0,0,What makes you think they were laughing at you?
0,0,0,When did you start experiencing this feeling of emptiness?
0,0,0,Perhaps is time to branch out as an actor and try other roles?
0,0,0,Nothing in you character is appealing, why do you think your appealing ?
0,0,0,I really don't think you should feel guilty for causing a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,And how did you feel, when you realized that the banana-skin recycling market had collapsed?
0,0,0,How long have you been feeling so empty?
0,0,0,I slipped into a comma.
0,0,0,Things just haven't been the same since hover boards.
0,0,0,I believe you may have banana-split-personality.
0,0,0,You can't be so thin skinned.
0,0,0,...and why do you feel it's a slippery slope?
0,0,0,Was that a fraudulent slip?
0,0,0,OK, so you had a slip and went a little bananas! Just get back on the wagon.
0,0,0,Why do you feel you are on the skids?
0,0,0,You use your slipperiness as your greatest defense, but deep inside, you feel truly empty.
0,0,0,What makes you think that your life is merely a punchline to one big joke?
0,0,0,I really can't win for losing; I'm either over or under ripe!
0,0,0,So, the reason for the split was over a choice of ice cream and nuts?
0,0,0,I understand you gave everything to a cream pie but it's time to move on.
0,0,0,Indeed, your 'haunting sense of disembodiment' certainly sounds very interesting, but I'm afraid that we're just about out of time.
0,0,0,Now tell me- how did that make you peel?
0,0,0,I'm a plantain, dammit!
0,0,0,I had no chance against the banana split.
0,0,0,DON'T WORRY, IN YOUR CONDITION IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE A SLIP
0,0,0,he left me for a gal named chiquita
0,0,0,Everyone feels used and abandoned at some point in their life.
0,0,0,You could probably get wealthy working at the next campaign debate.
0,0,0,Yes, I'm certain Freud didn't mean you should start at the VERY Beginning!
0,0,0,We share 50% of your genetic material, it only makes sense that we also share 50% of your problems.
0,0,0,You're not an enabler, everyone has a slip now and then
0,0,0,Let's explore more deeply these dreams where you're being chased by an ice cream truck
0,0,0,I think you have a conversion disorder
0,0,0,Whenever I get close to someone they split
0,0,0,Frankly, I don't find this session that appealing.
0,0,0,So she wanted a split?
0,0,0,How long has it been since he split?
0,0,0,Did the split end badly?
0,0,0,I think you may be suffering from a split personality.
0,0,0,My wife says I've lost my appeal.
0,0,0,Things have pretty much gone downhill since the end of vaudeville.
0,0,0,At what point did you start to feel him slipping away?
0,0,0,When did you start feeling empty?
0,0,0,Psycho analyst, not bananalyst.
0,0,0,It pains you when they say you are in cahoots with orthopedic surgeons?
0,0,0,And how does it make YOU feel that he slipped and broke his neck?
0,0,0,You've got to be skidding me!
0,0,0,So you're saying you feel very empty inside?
0,0,0,And you said the split left you feeling empty inside?
0,0,0,So when did you first feel like you had a split personality?
0,0,0,How long have you been a Banana Republican?
0,0,0,Not every slip is Freudian; sometimes it's just slapstick.
0,0,0,So you feel others don't find you appealing?
0,0,0,Should I call 911, your lover, or your wife?
0,0,0,And just when did you feel this relationship start slipping away?
0,0,0,I just feel like life is slipping away.
0,0,0,Ok, so how did it make you feel after you found out your mother was a plantain?
0,0,0,Like Jeb you have nothing left that appeals to anyone.
0,0,0,You shouldn't feel guilty that his leg was broken
0,0,0,Sorry, I'm not into erotic countertransference.
0,0,0,You see doc, I think I'm losing my a"peel"
0,0,0,When he ate you up and spit you out, how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,Tell me banana was it your hot temper that caused you to split?
0,0,0,Tell me your thoughts and let me peel apart your brain
0,0,0,Doc, I can't take the Freudian banana jokes anymore.
0,0,0,No, Mr. Split, your case is actually less straightforward, and more, say, slippery.
0,0,0,Tell me more about feeling discarded Mr. Peel.
0,0,0,I slipped up and now we're headed for splitsville.
0,0,0,So you broke away from the bunch you grew up with, and since then...you just haven't been peeling yourself?
0,0,0,You said before you were going to stop letting things slip.
0,0,0,You caused a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I don't care where you were last week.You still owe me 200.00.
0,0,0,Do you mean emotionally walked all over?
0,0,0,Your saying that Jimmy Durante is the last person to spin a positive message about bananas?
0,0,0,Why do you feel people look at you differently?
0,0,0,It is a slippery slope, indeed...
0,0,0,It's nothing to worry about. Stalking is part of your nature.
0,0,0,People slip on all kinds of things - don't feel so guilty.
0,0,0,I just feel empty.
0,0,0,So people step on you?
0,0,0,I have to ask, do you feel that you could be a danger to others?
0,0,0,I don't know what it is Doctor. I just don't see the humor in it anymore...
0,0,0,Let's peel back into your childhood.
0,0,0,Don't feel guilty--everyone slips up now and then.
0,0,0,Perhaps it was just a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,So you feel you've been discarded?
0,0,0,What I'm gathering from our conversation is that you feel empty inside.
0,0,0," Due to patient confidentiality, I cannot discuss the Onion and it's may layers. You, on the other hand, only have one.

0,0,0,Okay, so it was a breach of professional ethics, but... I was hungry.
0,0,0,Let's find a better way to say "crazy".
0,0,0,Doc, I have nothing left inside.
0,0,0,It almost sounds like you want to be stepped on.
0,0,0,Your problem is you blame yourself when others slip up.
0,0,0,I'm going to help you find your inner self
0,0,0,You say your mother loved apples, pears and peaches but not you?
0,0,0,"How long did you hang around with a bad bunch?

0,0,0,I just feel like I've lost myself.
0,0,0,And you are sure it wasn't just a slip up?
0,0,0,I know, I slipped up again!

0,0,0,What do -you- think you're a symbol of?
0,0,0,What do YOU think it means?
0,0,0,Being rejected by Chiquita is no reason to feel you've lost your a peel.
0,0,0,Let's examine the origins of your hostility toward silent comedians.
0,0,0,So where do you think you slipped up?

0,0,0,Banana Who
0,0,0,And tell me again why you think people laugh at you
0,0,0,You say you feel empty inside---tell me more.

0,0,0,He used to call me "appealing". Now, it's "appalling".
0,0,0,So you were born a banana but identify as a kumquat?
0,0,0,You're telling me it was a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Why so miffed? All I said was 'Sometimes a banana is just a banana.'
0,0,0,So people think you are slippery?
0,0,0,I'm glad to see you open up a little about your sex life.
0,0,0,But he's a watermelon rind, Ms. Chiquita . You didn't think there'd be issues?
0,0,0,Why do YOU think everyone laughs when you get stepped on?

0,0,0,So, it really was a banana in his pocket.
0,0,0,Do you have composting thoughts?
0,0,0,So you think people are laughing at YOU when someone slips and falls?
0,0,0,Doc, I'm in a bit of a slippery situation.
0,0,0,I can see your appeal.
0,0,0,What did the monkey do next?
0,0,0,After you gave him the slip, what happened next?
0,0,0,So, you think nobody finds you appealing?
0,0,0,So tell me when this feeling of emptiness began.
0,0,0,You're not fooling anyone, mr pendergraf.
0,0,0,Why do you think you're decomposing?
0,0,0,Not even your mother found you appealing?
0,0,0,So, explain why you feel unfulfilled with your life?
0,0,0,When did you first feel like you had lost your appeal?
0,0,0,Your time is up.
0,0,0,Tell me about the relationship before you split

0,0,0,It's NOT funny when people slip on me. It hurts!
0,0,0,Would the split have been better without whipped cream?
0,0,0,"It's a slippery slope".
0,0,0,I'm putting you on 10mg of Producezac.
0,0,0,I know you're more than just a phone.
0,0,0,No, I don't know where the banana went.
0,0,0,Why do you need my help since you are the perfect food?
0,0,0,So you feel your life is just slipping away?
0,0,0,I've spent all my life being stepped on.
0,0,0,I've been this way since the split.
0,0,0,I think you need to avoid that slippery slope.
0,0,0,So, you're always getting stepped on.
0,0,0,Your rationalizations are a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Ah, you think Xanax works better than talk therapy to reduce feelings of emptiness.
0,0,0,And when he slipped on you, Nan, how did it make you peel?
0,0,0,If the clown has forgiven you, don't you think it's time to let it go?

0,0,0,I never thought I'd meet the Invisible Man.
0,0,0,We don't see nuts until the second year of residency.
0,0,0,You’ve got to let go of the guilt. They’re supposed to slip on you.
0,0,0,Do you think other people ever feel empty inside?
0,0,0,Why do you feel you’re really a mango trapped in a banana peel?
0,0,0,Okay, let's start from when you were first pot-trained.
0,0,0,You say that people walk over you a lot?
0,0,0,I think it's time you stopped trying to understand you're a peel, and just accept it.
0,0,0,I understand the split has caused you a lot of grief.
0,0,0,so how do you feel being the cause of people's constant falls?
0,0,0,There's usually more to talk about once we've peeled back all these layers.
0,0,0,It's okay Mr. Peele, we all slip-up sometimes.
0,0,0,Don't worry about making a Freudian slip. I'm a Jungian.
0,0,0,Be easy on yourself. You're not the cause of people's Freudian slips.
0,0,0,I believe you should concentrate on potassium not phallicism
0,0,0,Everyone slips up now and then.

0,0,0,You've got to stop trying to give people the slip.
0,0,0,When did you start feeling guilty about collecting a share of the money in these fake slip and fall cases?
0,0,0,Why do you think your parents won't let you play with the other fruits?
0,0,0,I know it was a big loss, but you need to focus on you now.
0,0,0,So you feel people are laughing at you, not with you.
0,0,0,no,I don't think bananas are inferior to other fruit,Do you?
0,0,0,I wouldn't say the need to be slipped on is masochistic, per se, but you may be playing into society's expectations a teeny bit.
0,0,0,I don't peel too well.
0,0,0,No, it's totally natural for you to be aroused a drawing of a member of the opposite sex. That's normal, not only for banana peels, but also for grown men who have steady jobs and even, perhaps, a moderately popular Tumblr blog. Totally normal.
0,0,0,It sounds as though you're easily bruised.
0,0,0,Why do you feel he is una-peel-ing?
0,0,0,I'm afraid we don't accept patients on the Dole
0,0,0,Don't feel bad, he could have just as easily been hit by a truck.
0,0,0,Maybe slapstick isn't for you. Have you thought about standup?
0,0,0,Your openness is what makes you appealing.
0,0,0,Of course you feel altered, but appeal is still appeal.
0,0,0,You should use whichever bathroom you gender identify with.
0,0,0,When did you first start feeling empty inside?
0,0,0,Now that we've peeled off the layers, let's see what we're left with.

0,0,0,The "slippery slope" defence will not excuse your actions.
0,0,0,When did you first feel that that the people in your life were slipping away?
0,0,0,You're so much more than the descendant of a movie prop.
0,0,0,Classic case of a 'split' personality.
0,0,0,Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Why do you feel I've used you for my own personal gratification?
0,0,0,So you and your wife are headed to Splitsville?
0,0,0,So, Mr. Starr, how long has your marriage been on the rocks?
0,0,0,Your fear of becoming a vegetable is irrational.
0,0,0,No one deserves to be stepped on.
0,0,0,How many lawyers did you say you are working with?
0,0,0,"Best we have our next session after you've had lunch".
0,0,0,He's the one who lost appeal, not you!
0,0,0,Did you mean to say that, or was that a Freudian you-know-what?
0,0,0,It was just one slip up.
0,0,0,It's natural to feel empty inside.
0,0,0,I see you have slipped into something more comfortable.
0,0,0,Everyone I get close to just walks all over me. Then we both get hurt.
0,0,0,OK, let's peel back another layer.
0,0,0,So she gave you the slip?

0,0,0,You know sometimes a banana peel is just a banana peel
0,0,0,It seems like you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,I pealing low, I'm not getting the jokes I ones got.
0,0,0,George, I knew you were slippery.
0,0,0,But why do you think you feel so empty inside?
0,0,0,Tell me about the clowns.
0,0,0,You were telling me about your obsessive thoughts that everyone goes out of their way to avoid you.
0,0,0,Perhaps you feel you're slipping because you allow yourself to be stepped on.
0,0,0,Were you bruised as a child?
0,0,0,I just ate your banana, how does that make you feel?
0,0,0,So your last relationship left you feeling empty . . .
0,0,0,So, you think people are stepping on you?
0,0,0,And why do you think that your life is slipping away?
0,0,0,Do others in my position find that peeling off is actually a slippery slope?
0,0,0,Of course you feel empty, your banana split.
0,0,0,When did you first feel like a plantain in a banana's body?
0,0,0,What makes you think people are avoiding you?
0,0,0,I'm sick and tired of being blamed for everybody's pratfalls.
0,0,0,Say more about what is making you feel so unappealing.

0,0,0,It was traumatic! They ripped us from our stalks, shoved us in crates and nailed the lid shut. The next thing we knew, we were sold to a pushcart in Times Square.
0,0,0,Freudian slip and falls are normal.
0,0,0,Your diagnosis is split personality.
0,0,0,...and why do you find it funny to make people slip and fall?
0,0,0,I’m glad you’re comfortable discussing your peelings with me, but you’re bananas if you think I’m going to go out with you; mixing personal and professional relationships is a slippery slope, and besides I don’t find you to be all that appealing.
0,0,0,I don't know Doc, I literally feel split on the issue...
0,0,0," SO, at what point did you go Bananas?
0,0,0,YOU DREMPT YOU SAW GONZILLA, THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

0,0,0,Yet you still feel devoid of appeal?
0,0,0,One slip is not tantamount to a fall!
0,0,0,After I got over my envy and cowardice, I told them that black skin matters.
0,0,0,Yes, I can see you were ravaged from the backend. Be grateful- I haven't had as much as a nibble in the past 18 months.
0,0,0,Yes, it is possible to have a good split.
0,0,0,Why is orange the new black?
0,0,0,I agree "it's what is on the inside that counts" was passive-aggressive, but you can't let Tina get to you like that.
0,0,0,I see you've begun to peel away the layers to find the fruit of your issue.
0,0,0,You've peeled back a lot of layers in today's session.
0,0,0,Well you're off the floor now, and that's progress.
0,0,0,You're making too much of phallic symbolism -- and my gender is irrelevant.
0,0,0,So when did this slippery-slope fixation begin?
0,0,0,You gotta stop beating yourself up for the slip and fall.
0,0,0,It's not your responsibility to make everyone laugh.

0,0,0,First of all, you're not a joke.
0,0,0,Not as slippery as you think.
0,0,0,So you're saying you feel guilty you let someone slip on you.
0,0,0,After what happened at brunch on Sunday, I don't feel that it would be ethical for me to continue as your therapist.
0,0,0,Reassignment surgery is very difficult.
0,0,0,You need to find your center.
0,0,0,I think I'm finally getting under that skin of yours.
0,0,0,Let's peel back the emotional skin on your relationship with your Nana.
0,0,0,Yes, they're laughing, but let's explore why you think it's at you.

0,0,0,Your delusions have taken on a decidedly realistic character, Mr. Cavendish!
0,0,0,What can I say? I slipped up with a younger peel and the wife split. It's all so cliche.
0,0,0,So shall we call this "wish fulfillment"?
0,0,0,You think you're a banana peel - but it's in the nature of hallucinations to be untrue.
0,0,0,So you played 'monkey, panda, banana' once in college. That doesn't define you.

0,0,0,It's time for you to stop victim-blaming and admit that you're part of the problem.
0,0,0,...and sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,When were you first aware you could shape shift into a banana?
0,0,0,It's not your fault ... IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT!

0,0,0,you are not a shrinking violet are you?
0,0,0,Why do you feel the need to laugh when people step on you?
0,0,0,Your symptoms indicate a split personality...

0,0,0,Tell me again why you find a peel appalling.
0,0,0,Psychoanalysis is a slippery slope but some find it a peeling.
0,0,0,When did you first realize she was running around on you?
0,0,0,Is it my fault that people keep slipping on me?
0,0,0,I don't know doc, but I peel like a banana.

0,0,0,I have literally busted my ass on your case.
0,0,0,What makes you think you caused a Freudian slip?
0,0,0,Try thinking about it from the chimp's perspective.
0,0,0,I'm sorry but our time is ripe.
0,0,0,They weren't laughing at you, they were laughing at the guy who fell.
0,0,0,So, you say you've never been the same since you woke up to find a tarantula in your crate?
0,0,0,Tell me about your accident dreams.
0,0,0,But what if you saw yourself as 'appealing' ?
0,0,0,So tell me...How long ago did he split?

0,0,0,How long have you felt this emptiness?
0,0,0,What do you think she meant by Second Banana?
0,0,0,I tried to help, but he called me a mirage, so I let him be.
0,0,0,You think you got problems. I just ate a client.
0,0,0,No, it's not my turn.
0,0,0,I understand how you self identify, but I am not calling you a fruit.
0,0,0,We all get stepped on.
0,0,0,So......how long have you had this feeling that you are always being stepped on.....?
0,0,0,I wouldn't say split personality
0,0,0,Doctor, I don't understand why women don't find me a-peeling.
0,0,0,You need to become more comfortable in your own skin.
0,0,0,Okay. So you're tired of being set up as the fall guy.
0,0,0,It's too soon to say if it's split personality disorder, but the diagnosis is appealing.
0,0,0,So, you are saying that it made you go bananas that she called you 'honey' and then dumped you?
0,0,0,Define "Used fruit"
0,0,0,I just feel empty and angry,i want to hurt people make them slip and fall.

0,0,0,I'd say you're at the bottom of a slippery slope.
0,0,0,So tell me again about your mother. She thought you were too ripe for your age?
0,0,0,I'm just tired of always getting stepped on, you know?
0,0,0,Try to be even more revealing.
0,0,0,We're going to try something new today.
0,0,0,Potassium absolutely will not make you disappear.
0,0,0,Okay, let's try peeling back the layers now, shall we.
0,0,0,You say you've lost your inner self?
0,0,0,You need to forgive yourself. If somebody slipped on you and got hurt, that's not your fault!
0,0,0,I can't explain it, I'm just going bananas!
0,0,0,You have to come out of your shell.
0,0,0,I BELIEVE YOU LEFT YOUR SEAT-WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS ?
0,0,0,Quit blaming yourself. You are not the cause of a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Your wife has no reason to be jealous of me. Have HER psychiatrist check her potassium levels.
0,0,0,So, you have trouble with your partner saying he's top banana when everyone else can see you're appeal?
0,0,0,Let's explore "I feel empty inside".
0,0,0,I can't date my clients sweetie, its slippery slope.
0,0,0,Were you peeling any better after last week's session?
0,0,0,When did you first notice this complex with onions?
0,0,0,''Lily, tell me why you feel your world has turned upside down.''
0,0,0,How can I help you stay on that divan?
0,0,0,I'm just tired of constantly getting stepped on, you know?
0,0,0,You feel like everything around you is slipping into chaos?
0,0,0,You mean, after all these sessions, you still feel stepped on?
0,0,0,I CAN'T GET OVER MY GUILT AT MAKING DR. FREUD SLIP
0,0,0,And you've grown tired of being the butt of that joke!
0,0,0,And tell me–how did that make you peel?
0,0,0,This feeling of emptiness, is it after the slip and fall?
0,0,0,And when did you first feel yourself slipping?
0,0,0,Wilted Lilly, banana peel, octopus, - you need to identify with your real self.
0,0,0,Sorry, the doctor - patient relationship prevents me from "Slipping the Light Fantastic" with you.
0,0,0,So you feel used and discarded?
0,0,0,Let me get this straight. You are stressed over a slip and fall because you think it is your fault?
0,0,0,You slipped up.
0,0,0,Stop undressing me with your eyes...
0,0,0,I peeled when my banana split!
0,0,0,You have to learn to face the ugly truth; after this election, slapstick is dead.
0,0,0,Depressed because you're no longer one of the bunch?
0,0,0,George must have finished his banana early. He needs a new one.
0,0,0,So, have you always thought of yourself as 'appealing'?
0,0,0,I am curious - yellow.
0,0,0,Please come out from under the couch, Bongo.
0,0,0,Or...could the reason you feel empty inside stem back to your childhood?
0,0,0,Why do you think you lost your appeal?
0,0,0,Tell me about the Foster home.
0,0,0,Let's not talk about the split; let's talk about the bruises.
0,0,0,I had a slip of the tongue and the next thing you know she was doing a double somersault in to the pool
0,0,0,And how often do you get this overwhelming urge to see people slip and fall?
0,0,0,Ok, let's begin. Tell me how you peel.
0,0,0,Tell me more about these feelings you have about always being on the outside....
0,0,0,Did you say "Alabama"?
0,0,0,It all started as a little joke.
0,0,0,I know you are a peeling but that's not what I meant
0,0,0,Don't be discouraged – not all women care about that.
0,0,0,I feel like a shell of my former self.
0,0,0,So, how was week's experiment with oral sex?
0,0,0,Tell me why the peeling was so emasculating.
0,0,0,I'm not so sure that bananopause is a real thing.
0,0,0,After you say you "slipped-up," then what happened.
0,0,0,You were having dessert and your banana split?
0,0,0,I don't understand, Doc. I just feel empty inside.
0,0,0,Tell me more about these feeling of abandonment. Where do you feel it in your body?
0,0,0,So I'm hearing that you have a fear of bringing others down
0,0,0,And how does it make you feel when you think people are avoiding you?
0,0,0,You have fears of falling?
0,0,0,when did this sense of emptiness begin and how do you feel about it?
0,0,0,Bobo, are you still there?
0,0,0,Let's discuss last week's Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I'm just a shell of what I once was.
0,0,0,Tell me why you feel that you’re just a shell of your old self.
0,0,0,....and the Donald said I'll turn you into a banana peal
0,0,0,Accident schmaccident. Now tell me about your mother.
0,0,0,And so this reckless impulse to make people slip and fall, this started after the smoothie incident?
0,0,0,How long have you and your ex been split up?
0,0,0,And when you were peeled, how did that make you feel?
0,0,0,I guess it all started with Orange and that damn knock-knock joke...Why? Why are people glad he doesn't say Banana? What does that say about me?
0,0,0,Let’s circle back to your comment about feeling empty inside.
0,0,0,Do you accept Blue Cross Blue Peeled?
0,0,0,Interesting... When did your parents split?
0,0,0,So, why are you feeling do empty?
0,0,0,Why do YOU think you others find you unappealing?
0,0,0,In retrospect, do you feel the trip to zoo was a good idea?
0,0,0,The monkeys are just tearing my family apart.
0,0,0,It's not your fault - accidents happen.
0,0,0,You're not a nut case.
0,0,0,You've got five seconds to get that banana back in the peel.
0,0,0,You've been here over an hour and haven't said a thing. How am I supposed to help you?
0,0,0,I don't know why she left you. Maybe you just didn't a-peel to her?
0,0,0,Separation anxiety is traumatic but you shouldn't feel like garbage.
0,0,0,Separation anxiety is not uncommon in your situation.
0,0,0,So believe you have a thin skin.
0,0,0,Don't be paranoid, you don't cause ALL falls!
0,0,0,So, you're saying it was not consensual?
0,0,0,How did that make you peel? Feel -- I mean feel. I promise that wasn't a Freudian slip...
0,0,0,You might be interested to know that my other clients who are living with banana-split-personality disorder tend to self-medicate--with toppings and the like.
0,0,0,Why do you feel that everyone thinks of you as a big joke?
0,0,0,And what makes you think they're not laughing with you?
0,0,0,Well, I suppose the only thing left for you to do is compost yourself.
0,0,0,It's normal to feel that you've lost your inner self at times, but I'm afraid it's permanent in your case.
0,0,0,What makes you think people don't take you seriously?
0,0,0,I always feel this caption contest is rigged against me.
0,0,0,As Camus said, we must learn to live without appeal.
0,0,0,Your Freudian slips are nothing, my two o'clock thinks he's just a cigar.
0,0,0,Tony! I thought you would never change
0,0,0,Not always. Sometimes a slip is just a slip.
0,0,0,So you feel rejected?
0,0,0,You have to stop being the scapegoat for everyone else's slip ups!
0,0,0,Well,... I ...didn't think it was funny!
0,0,0,Careful, that's a slipper slope.
0,0,0,So, you failed at becoming completely at one with your favorite ice cream?
0,0,0,So how would you describe your appeal?
0,0,0,Theres nothing funny about being a doormat.
0,0,0,I have a reoccurring dream that I am on this slippery slope.
0,0,0,'Empty inside?' Elaborate.
0,0,0,Lets discuss your split personality.
0,0,0,I'm tired of being the butt of everyone's joke.
0,0,0,It's no accident that you're here.
0,0,0,Why do you feel that people are avoiding you?
0,0,0,Relax and you'll peel better.
0,0,0,You seem to have slipped since our last session.
0,0,0,I feel my appeal is slipping, Doctor
0,0,0,So you've made some slip ups... Tell me more.
0,0,0,Last week you were a cockroach
0,0,0,No, Robert, I asked you to show me how you FEEL.
0,0,0,How did you feel when he threw you aside?
0,0,0,He said he didn't find me appealing anymore
0,0,0,It's a real breakthrough that you feel sorry for causing pain to others. Now we have to work on you taking responsibility for your actions instead of blaming the cartoons.
0,0,0,So you're telling me that you think people walk all over you.
0,0,0,So you didn't like being referred to as "slippery?"
0,0,0,It all started in Ecuador! I was the smallest of the bunch.........!
0,0,0,So, how long have you had this peeling feeling?
0,0,0,You seem to have a lack of potassium. Could this be affecting your erectile dysfunction?
0,0,0,Help me understand why your Psychosexual development is stuck in the phallic stage.
0,0,0,Tell me more about how you and your bunch slid across the border.
0,0,0,It's natural to feel empty after a loss.
0,0,0,I'm glad that you finally opened up.
0,0,0,He left you for a sundae-let's start there.
0,0,0,Perhaps the term 'fruit' was descriptive, not derogatory.
0,0,0,I don't know doc, I think I'm just tired of being sexually objectified.
0,0,0,Please Chill Out Doc !
0,0,0,I see why you feel so empty inside.
0,0,0,It's only normal to be experiencing separation anxiety.
0,0,0,How would you like it, Doc, if they ripped off all of your clothes?
0,0,0,I feel like I've lost my center.
0,0,0,Did you start to feel empty inside before or after the accident?
0,0,0,You say you don't get along with the rest of your bunch
0,0,0,So you're saying you felt used?
0,0,0,And in this recurring nightmare, nobody slips?
0,0,0,just slip into something more comfortable
0,0,0,You can't just wait for things to fall into place.
0,0,0,I'm diagnosing you with a Split Personality
0,0,0,It seems like everything is one big punchline to you.
0,0,0,So those are my choices, garbage or compost. And that's what I'm paying you for?
0,0,0,So tel me how you feel, Mr. Banana Peel... How did you feel about being thrown out?
0,0,0,When I told you to try peeling back the layers, I meant of your subconscious.
0,0,0,Carrie Bradshaw I'm not!
0,0,0,How long have you felt that people were laughing at you?
0,0,0,I thought it was a minor slip-up.
0,0,0,I feel you slipping away
0,0,0,Kafka or not, the answer is still no.
0,0,0,What do you mean you "gave him the slip"?
0,0,0,At least you're no longer green with envy.
0,0,0,When he slipped, how did you feel about that?
0,0,0,You are appealing, yet others avoid you. How does that make you feel?
0,0,0,All I suggested to you is to meditate in the lotus position, which has nothing to do with the ancient spell transforming a person into a lotus !
0,0,0,'I'm pleased to see you've picked yourself up off the floor.'
0,0,0,And what makes you think I'm going to fall for you?
0,0,0,Actually, you may have to face the fact that becoming passé in slapstick might mean that now your act is rubbish..
0,0,0,What is it that makes you feel so empty inside ?
0,0,0,Guilt? Why? After all, he stepped on you.
0,0,0,You've lost touch with your inner self.
0,0,0,So after the baby, he split?
0,0,0,Yes, you remain appealing.
0,0,0,When do you believe you started down that slippery slope of ice cream addiction?
0,0,0,i know you feel empty inside since your husband split, but you still have appeal
0,0,0,So this empty feeling began how soon after he moved out?
0,0,0,Do you really believe that there is no such thing as an accident?
0,0,0,It's evident to me that your problems are more than skin deep.
0,0,0,So when did you first begin to feel like garbage?
0,0,0,Doc, I'm tired of feeling empty inside.
0,0,0,When did you first realize you were really a plantain?
0,0,0,You don't look delusional to me, really.
0,0,0,That's very interesting, tell me how that makes you peel.
0,0,0,We've been over this a million times. I don't know why she doesn't find you appealing
0,0,0,Lying on a sidewalk may be your most rewarding career option!
0,0,0,What do you want me to tell Romney?
0,0,0,No, it's perfectly natural for you to be aroused by a drawing of a member of the opposite sex. That's totally normal, not only for banana peels, but also for grown men who have steady jobs and even, perhaps, a popular Tumblr blog. Totally normal.
0,0,0,What's the difference between a Freudian slip and a Jungian slip?
0,0,0,Following the split-up, it's important for you not to slip into a bad place.
0,0,0,Actually, I often wear a stalk of limp asparagus in my hair. Think of at as a conversation starter or even an homage to your Kingdom.
0,0,0,I can see that confidence is not your problem.
0,0,0,Have you still been dreaming about the monkeys?
0,0,0,So tell me again why your parents split.
0,0,0,The bigger picture is the laughter and joy for the children, not the physical discomfort to the individual.
0,0,0,So you went "bananas"…and that's when you think you lost your a peel?
0,0,0,Sorry about my little Freudian split -I mean, slip, sorry!
0,0,0,So, you feel like an accident waiting to happen?
0,0,0,Seriously, you can't let people step all over you and then tell you it's your fault.
0,0,0,Why do you think people are avoiding you?
0,0,0,I've been told I have an unhealthy attraction to shoes; by the way are yours Jimmy Choos?
0,0,0,Why don't you think you're appealing?
0,0,0,You had a major break through by pealing back your emotions, getting to the core and storing the flesh of the problem where it belongs.
0,0,0,I'm trying to figure out if you need to go to the rest room or rest home.
0,0,0,Don't go bananas on me! You've been through these split-ups before.
0,0,0,You have an inedible complex.
0,0,0,Your going to have to forgive yourself for the harm you've caused to others.
0,0,0,You have a certain "a peel", you just need to wait for the right person to come along and fall for you.
0,0,0,I feel split whenever somebody slips on me.
0,0,0,It's either my overbearing mother or this weekly caption contest thing.
0,0,0,I understand you feel guilty, but it is not your fault.
0,0,0,On a positive note, I can safely say you are not nuts.
0,0,0,I'm going to recommend a Jungian colleague of mine.
0,0,0,For my whole life I couldn't identify being a banana. Now with your help Doctor I can tell the world I'm a Pineapple!.
0,0,0,Orange you glad I didn't ask you how you feel?
0,0,0,I don't know if I should help you or compost you.
0,0,0,Why do you feel that you're an accident waiting to happen?
0,0,0,Yes, banana lives matter.
0,0,0,There are other slips besides Freudian
0,0,0,It's time for a change. You're empty inside. Your words are slippery; your behavior's rotten.
0,0,0,We have to address your doormat complex.
0,0,0,Doc, am I too thin-skinned in feeling that I've been stripped and discarded...?
0,0,0,Just because your father was a plantain, it doesn't mean you're not bananas.
0,0,0,Tell me about the time when she slipped
0,0,0,Ever since he left I feel empty inside.
0,0,0,I feel like I've served my purpose in life
0,0,0,"Trust me; sometimes a banana is just a banana".
0,0,0,So tell me, why do you think you're a couch potato?
0,0,0,I didn't mean to literally make like a banana and split.
0,0,0,So, tell me more about your obsession with abruptly bring people down to your level.
0,0,0,So, you're here to resolve your anxiety about "one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel"?
0,0,0,Everything after "Here comes the bride" is a blur.
0,0,0,I think you might be taking 'Freudian Slip' too seriously.
0,0,0,Skin treatment.
0,0,0,Yes, most peels go through separation anxiety.
0,0,0,So how did that make you feel when "chiquited' on you?
0,0,0,And you say that's when you started to feel things were slipping?
0,0,0,No one ever finds me appealing.
0,0,0,At what age did you start wanting to hurt people ?
0,0,0,It's like every man I attract turns out to be a total monkey.
0,0,0,How did you feel when your friends ripened and you didn't
0,0,0,You may have a banana-split personality
0,0,0,How does that make you peel ... sorry, I mean feel?
0,0,0,A bunch of guys keep calling me a 'plantain.' How can I cope with such hurtful bullying?
0,0,0,You are clearly not the victim here.
0,0,0,I can't stress it enough but your empty feeling has nothing to do with your mother.
0,0,0,That’s a slippery slope.
0,0,0,Beauty is only skin deep.
0,0,0,Why do you think others find you unappealing?
0,0,0,Please tell me how do you peel since our last session
0,0,0,Really, your the victim?
0,0,0,Our relationship is just fruitless.
0,0,0,How does it make you feel being called a Latundan banana?
0,0,0,So when did you first start feeling like you're "an accident waiting to happen"?
0,0,0,When did you first notice people avoiding you?
0,0,0,Doc, I'm worried I'm bipolar; sometimes I feel like a banana and other times a plantain
0,0,0,I knew you found me a-peeling
0,0,0,Do you remember where you were when you first noticed that "you lost it?"
0,0,0,Hmmn...........sounds like you're playing the fall guy again
0,0,0,Tell me about your bunch.
0,0,0,If you are Chiquita banana, what have you come to say?
0,0,0,Why, because I like to sit like this - but wait I'm the one who asks the questions. You won't slip this by me.
0,0,0,When he peeled you off, he didn't say he was coming back?
0,0,0,Your problems stem from low potassium levels.
0,0,0,So you're afraid you might be a danger to others?
0,0,0,I'm just tired of being stepped on, Doc.
0,0,0,Exactly when was the last time you had a bite?
0,0,0,You need to stop letting people walk all over you.
0,0,0,How long have you had this sense of rejection?
0,0,0,And you say everybody laughs at you?
0,0,0,Four foot, six foot, eight foot bunch?
0,0,0,And did you begin to experience these feelings of depression when you realized that you were never going to be top banana?
0,0,0,Would it be that bad if you were always a second banana?
0,0,0,Tell me about your "foster" parents.
0,0,0,You really shouldn't worry so much. I'm sure people find you appealing.
0,0,0,Yes, I'm sure slippery guilt is hard to deal with>
0,0,0,Who put this banana's peel here?
0,0,0,Don't worry. We all have times when we feel less a-peeling to others.
0,0,0,I don't care if you're just the peel. Stop looking up my skirt!
0,0,0,Fermenting is a dead-end
0,0,0,How long have you had this feeling of being a mere shell of your former self?
0,0,0,As a peel, how does that make you feel?
0,0,0,I have become a couch potato
0,0,0,Pleeeese, stop with the Freudian slip jokes! I get the irony.
0,0,0,Sure, you miss the old bunch. But you'll always have 69 cents a pound.
0,0,0,I'm sorry I can't see you anymore but I'm limiting my practice to vegetables
0,0,0,So - you don't find it funny anymore?
0,0,0,It may all seem fruitless now, but be careful not to slide down that slippery slope.
0,0,0,Peelings are flippery sthings.
0,0,0,I never realized how much it took out of me to get that monkey off my back.
0,0,0,Liking chocolate, vanilla , and strawberry are signs of a split personality.
0,0,0,You're going to stop Donald Trump how?
0,0,0,Whether I find you appealing is beside the point
0,0,0,Of course you feel discarded and useless, but you have value, you do!
0,0,0,No, I will not fall for you--that would be completely inappropriate.
0,0,0,So you're saying the banana split.
0,0,0,You have to understand, everyone slips My friend Scott Dixon came up with this one
0,0,0,You'll have to be hospitalized. You're a danger to others.
0,0,0,Not to fret, we have plenty to work on other than your inner self.
0,0,0,Stop, you've peeled enough layers, there's nothing left.
0,0,0,Everything's a "slippery slope" to you.
0,0,0,And what was her reaction to you calling her a "monkey" ?
0,0,0,And why did that appeal to you?
0,0,0,And what makes you think people don't take you seriously?
0,0,0,Sad to say, you're not the first to leave the bunch green, have your body exploited and cast aside on the streets.
0,0,0,I agree. The black upholstered chain has appeal. Now what?
0,0,0,Who slipped that peel in here?
0,0,0,I understand you feel she was eating you alive.
0,0,0,So Tell Me,Why Are You Not Peeling Very Well ?
0,0,0,You'll always be appealing.
0,0,0,So she told you that you have "a peel," but no substance underneath, hmm?
0,0,0,And why do you feel she was delighted over the split?
0,0,0,This may sound unprofessional, but I find you appealing
0,0,0,...And you feel that something is missing?
0,0,0,It's been six months, Lucille. I don't think he's coming back.
0,0,0,Tell me about this human in your pocket.
0,0,0,I don't care about your planet, here you are just a seed pod.
0,0,0,There are no more layers to peel.
0,0,0,So this sense of being used has left you a shell of your former self
0,0,0,Do you still feel that everyone you come into contact with ends up hurt?
0,0,0,I understand why you detest monkeys.
0,0,0,Hmm, I guess that was a banana in his pocket.
0,0,0,What! Sure, I know humans share 50% of our DNA with bananas...but, I don't share!
0,0,0,Listen Bud, I'm your analyst; NOT your sexual surrogate!
0,0,0,Yes, you're a peel, but you have appeal.
0,0,0,So he slipped. People laughed. It’s not really your fault.
0,0,0,So you're feeling a void?
0,0,0,And how long have you been feeling like you aren't taken seriously?
0,0,0,You have banana envy.
0,0,0,He overheard hunter's wife say he only shoots blanks.
0,0,0,So how much has this separation cost you?
0,0,0,Forget the Onion. Try pealing back these layers.
0,0,0,Split personality ?
0,0,0,You’ve got to stop dating these clowns who walk all over you and then act like it’s all a joke.
0,0,0,Next thing I knew, she split off with some guys named Ben and Jerry.
0,0,0,Maybe you want to be stepped on.
0,0,0,You can't let the down fall of some many be totally your responsibility.
0,0,0,Textbook Freudian slip.
0,0,0,People are always walking all over me.
0,0,0,Sure, you have appeal, but you need to work on your inner slime.
0,0,0,Since when did therapy have such a broad, a peel?
0,0,0,So you say you're solo act isn't working?
0,0,0,Usually there's something there when I peel back the layers.
0,0,0,I'm just constantly getting stepped on, you know?
0,0,0,What's your greatest fear at the zoo?
0,0,0,She got under your skin but we can work on it.
0,0,0,Explain what you mean by you feel your slipping away
0,0,0,Listen Slick, one more "cute little old lady falling for me" and we're finished.
0,0,0,Just because they're laughing - doesn't make it a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,If you were a fruit, which one would you be?
0,0,0,Under the right circumstances you could be half of a comedy team, you have a future in show business. Forget being furniture oil.
0,0,0,Lately, I feel empty inside.
0,0,0,Thank you, you're a peeling too
0,0,0,Have you always felt this comfortable in your own skin?
0,0,0,Now tell me why you and your other half split?
0,0,0,You still have appeal.
0,0,0,Did you say 'pear or pair'?
0,0,0,I keep having this dream where every guy I meet falls flat on his ass.
0,0,0,I think you have a split personality.
0,0,0,So your spouse thinks you share DNA with a banana?
0,0,0,When did you first notice that you feel like a sight gag?
0,0,0,Wait, do you think you're not "a peeling" or not "appealing"?
0,0,0,Hey, you may think it's ok to look up a lady's skirt when you're on the sidewalk but not here.
0,0,0,. . . and you think I'm appealing?
0,0,0,But surely there are some positives you can find in being 'just a slapstick trope'?
0,0,0,Not to worry....everyone has a slip now and then in therapy.
0,0,0,Note to self: Tell Macy’s they sent the wrong slip cover.
0,0,0,I get the slips and falls, but you can't blame yourself for rise of ISIS.
0,0,0,I think I need to see a doctor, I'm peeling
0,0,0,Oh, I don't know Mr. Trump...It seems your lobotomy went quite well.
0,0,0,I can't help it, I am naturally attracted to people with one foot in the grave.
0,0,0,So it's not that people walk all over you...it's that they literally avoid you?
0,0,0,Just because you feel like a fish out of water doesn't necessarily mean you're squidzophrenic.
0,0,0,You feel guilty about causing someone to slip?
0,0,0,What makes you think she purposefully left you behind?
0,0,0,Talk to me about your Freudian slip.
0,0,0,My id couldn't make it.
0,0,0,The liposuction has had the opposite effect; now people completely avoid me.
0,0,0,So, when did the slide start?
0,0,0,Was it a nasty split with Chiquita?
0,0,0,With a slip, one is too many and a thousand not enough.
0,0,0,My fear of death intensified with the appearance of brown spots.
0,0,0,Can we unpack this? I know that when you're stepped on people laugh, but why do you think they're laughing at you?
0,0,0,How long have you had this empty feeling?
0,0,0,You'll fall for me someday. They all do, eventually.
0,0,0,Can you tell me more about the man that ate you?
0,0,0,So, when did people start calling you passive aggressive?
0,0,0,Lets talk about your feelings of emptiness.
0,0,0,No. I'm pretty sure Freud wouldn't have appreciated that kind of slip.
0,0,0,How are you peeling?
0,0,0,But it’s not like they’re trying to step on you….
0,0,0,On the bright side, someone really enjoyed that banana daiquiri.
0,0,0,And how does it make you feel when people cautiously step around?
0,0,0,When did you first realize that you were losing your grip.
0,0,0,I'm tired of people stepping on me.
0,0,0,No, you are not delusional. You really are a banana.
0,0,0,You've peeled back the layers but you continue to slip.
0,0,0,Sorry, you can't copyright the Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Are you saying that you've lost a peel?
0,0,0,You say you've been feeling empty since the split?
0,0,0,You could always ask your cousin, Mr. Pineapple if he'll have you over for the holidays.
0,0,0,Just how many do you feel have banana envy?
0,0,0,Not to worry, it's slip covered.
0,0,0,Yes, I promise, no Freudian slip jokes.
0,0,0,I don't think appeal is what you're lacking.
0,0,0,And, how long have you felt like a banana peel?
0,0,0,How long have you felt like and empty-suit?'\
0,0,0,I just feel like I'm the butt of everyone's jokes.
0,0,0,I think I'm a grape.
0,0,0,Why do you think you bruise so easily?
0,0,0,Okay, so why is it that you don't consider yourself very appealing?
0,0,0,I'm feeling bruised and empty, just like the rest of the bunch.
0,0,0,He's just not that into you.
0,0,0,At this point, you're just arguing apples and oranges.
0,0,0,Let's get real here. This is not just some joke. Have you ever considered it might be, "up slip," not, "slip up," that is your real motivation?
0,0,0,What do you mean, exactly, by uncomfortable in your own skin?
0,0,0,And how do the bruises and the emptiness make you feel?
0,0,0,Well, my mother started hanging with a pretty ripe bunch, that's when my Dad split.
0,0,0,The separation anxiety is easier to treat than the hollow feeling.
0,0,0,Let's talk about your split.
0,0,0,Every time the psychiatrists' convention is in town, I make a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,The last time I saw Olive was in a salad.
0,0,0,You’re the Freudian slip expert. Do you think naming the nursing home after me is appropriate?
0,0,0,And the guy tripped and I went flying and landed on Donald Trump's head, and nobody noticed.
0,0,0,Well? What's eating you?
0,0,0,If you really want to be of use, I suggest you get yourself into a brown bag with your unripe friend avocado!!
0,0,0,You don’t think you’re appealing?
0,0,0,I find you a peeling too
0,0,0,Yours is the clearest case of an unresolved edible complex I have encountered in years.
0,0,0,So your dream was about a band of hungry monkeys.
0,0,0,Do you blame yourself for keeping the doctor away?
0,0,0,How much can I charge a banana?
0,0,0,My son's caption for last week's bird on gun barrel cartoon (it's from Lord Of the Rings) "Like they say, the closer we are to danger the farther we are from harm." My issue yesterday, late but I wanted to share his suggestion.
0,0,0,I have this dream that I am no longer appealing.
0,0,0,So tell me why do you think you are feeling depleted.
0,0,0,So you're blaming Ben & Jerry for the split...is that right?
0,0,0,Don't worry. I've concealed your identity. I called you The Orange Peel Man.
0,0,0,You shouldn't feel inferior just because you're not labelled organic.
0,0,0,Peeling away that ego is a good first step.
0,0,0,So you feel the best part of you is gone.
0,0,0,Under these circumstances, my rate is on a sliding scale
0,0,0,How do you peel about that- ugh, sorry, trigger word. My mistake.
0,0,0,This must've been a devastating split-up.
0,0,0,So my wife got nuts and I split.
0,0,0,Let's talk about your feeling bruised and discarded.
0,0,0,At least you won't slip up on one.
0,0,0,For a banana peel, you're actually doing really well.
0,0,0,I hear you and I understand. Simple fruits can be complex under the skin--you peeling back will make this a productive session.
0,0,0,So tell me more about this empty feeling you have.
0,0,0,'And you think the Freudian kind is taken more seriously than yours?'
0,0,0,I agree, I do think she was just using you.
0,0,0,Again, you're heading down a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I just feel so empty inside since we split.
0,0,0,Tell me how you're peeling today
0,0,0,Doctor, I love your legs, but your body language isn't helping me overcome the feelings of prejudice and discrimination we feel ever since those damned cartoonists began using us as an artistic device to represent slippery dog droppings.
0,0,0,Freudian slips come naturally to me.
0,0,0,...and THEN they put me in the refrigerator!
0,0,0,I'd like to discuss your sudden weight loss.
0,0,0,And what does your wife say when you turn into a banana?
0,0,0,It's extremely common to develop feelings for your therapist. I'm going to recommend another doctor for you to visit." "I was literally inside you five minutes ago, Jill.
0,0,0,You're telling me that your banana split for someone with a younger peel?
0,0,0,When around your peers, do you feel comfortable in your own peel?
0,0,0,Is it comedy or tragedy when someone slips on you?
0,0,0,Do you suppose it's the loss of your inner self?
0,0,0,Yes, you could say we both make a lot of 'bread'.
0,0,0,The first peel is the deepest.
0,0,0,If you site like this, with your peels crossed, I'm sure the jokes will stop.
0,0,0,And that's how it came to be called the 'Freudian slip.'
0,0,0,My parents split.
0,0,0,So your grandfather was in vaudeville ?
0,0,0,This may stem from your fear of slipping
0,0,0,Okay, your career as a condom model is over, but what about slapstick comedy?
0,0,0,We're not talking about the slips of others...we're talking about yours!
0,0,0,Now that you've slipped into something more comfortable...."
0,0,0,Then I was rejected as one of the bunch.
0,0,0,Ok, Ok, I know I should be over the appeal jokes. I just seem to trip on it every time.
0,0,0,Believe it or not, I too struggled for years to figure out whether I had appeal.
0,0,0,So, you feel like you're not all there? Empty inside?
0,0,0,My, aren't we thin skinned!
0,0,0,Chaise longues are great, but I prefer hammocks.
0,0,0,People slip and fall for lots of reasons; you've got to stop blaming yourself.
0,0,0,So, you feel you're the slip up in other people's lives.
0,0,0,It wasn't your fault somebody slipped on you.
0,0,0,How long have you been separated?
0,0,0,I don't know how to tell you this, but that whole 'getting eaten' thing was not a dream.
0,0,0,You know Doc, I feel as though I've been slipping a lot lately.
0,0,0,It all started when my parents split
0,0,0,You have slipped backwards in your therapy. No, your advances towards me are not appealing , and I also disagree that hanging around with your friends has nothing to do with your current situation.
0,0,0,So when did you start feeling you weren't one of the bunch?
0,0,0,So it's the strawberries & banana thing?
0,0,0,Caution: Extra-slippery puns at play.
0,0,0,I can't help you if you are going to continue to use such slippery language.
0,0,0,So tell me why it is you think you've, as you said earlier, "gone bananas?"
0,0,0,We both knew this day would come. How do you feel about the next stage of your life and career?
0,0,0,Tell me more about your infatuation with hammocks.
0,0,0,When did you start feeling empty inside?
0,0,0,This void you feel, I'm afraid it is real.
0,0,0,So, why do you think it would be fruitless to try?
0,0,0,And why do you want them to stop falling for your appeal?
0,0,0,I see you're learning to pull back your skin and show your true self.
0,0,0,Let's explore these feelings of loss and abandonment.
0,0,0,This new paleo diet seems rather strict.
0,0,0,OK..... I'd like to go back to that time in your life when you tried to form a republic
0,0,0,I lost my self-confidence after I slipped on a banana peel
0,0,0,Don't get all mushy on me.
0,0,0,I know you are feeling slippery right now but its just a phase.
0,0,0,Trust me, you're not the first. At least half my patients are 'bananas'.
0,0,0,When did start feeling like garbage?
0,0,0,And how did it feel to be called a fruit?
0,0,0,Would you like to talk about what's eating you?
0,0,0,It can get slippery when you open up.
0,0,0,Tell me more about your mother.
0,0,0,And how long have you felt like people on the street are avoiding you?
0,0,0,Damn genie said I'd be TOP BANANA!
0,0,0,Knock, Knock
0,0,0,You mustn't blame yourself for other people's slip-ups.
0,0,0,That's quite the Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I think you experienced a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,Maybe next session we can discuss your fear of sliding into oblivion.
0,0,0,Well, Mr. Trump, you may have lost the election but you have certainly kept your coiffure and your dishwater pheromones.
0,0,0,What I think you are telling me is that you feel unwanted.
0,0,0,Doctor, I'd like to get back with my ex. I just can't handle the constant slip-ups."
0,0,0,How long have you felt that your mind was slipping?
0,0,0,I don't find your story appealing.
0,0,0,I gotta tell you, doc, your fashion sense is driving me bananas.
0,0,0,So just when did you split
0,0,0,Why do you feel people don't take you seriously?
0,0,0,Sure you have issues but I'm the one talking to a banana peel.
0,0,0,So she dumped you for the top banana?
0,0,0,Then I told her "hey, you slipped up, not me".
0,0,0,Tell me more about this sidewalk compulsion...
0,0,0,You say you're thick-skinned, but people have seen through your façade and have taken advantage of you.
0,0,0,You believe you've been replaced by a protein tablet.
0,0,0,It appears you have commitment issues.
0,0,0,I feel like I'm slipping.
0,0,0,So, he fell for you hard, and you find that funny?
0,0,0,Looking at it positively, he may have left you but you still have a peel.
0,0,0,You're so much more than just a peel.
0,0,0,So, she stepped on you. How do you feel about that?
0,0,0,It matters not what I think you are. Do you identify as a banana peel without the elongated edible fruit, or a lily blossom with a short stem?
0,0,0,I still feel terrified whenever someone mentions monkeys, or zoos.
0,0,0,Let's begin by peeling off the layers.
0,0,0,It sounds like abandonment issues to me. Having a father split at a young age can be very tough.
0,0,0,So, your're afraid she'll dump you when she discovers that you're not really a plantain, just a plain old banana, banana peel at that? I'd be worried too.
0,0,0,It's time you channeled that emptiness...say, into a career in slapstick.
0,0,0,Get over it. Your life is one big joke.
0,0,0,In dreams, sometimes a banana is just a banana.
0,0,0,Last night I dreamt that Freud slipped on me!
0,0,0,You don't like people falling all over you?
0,0,0,Slippin', sliden' away--is that your mantra?
0,0,0,"Mr. Wilson, it is true. Bananas and bacon are not longer in flavor.
0,0,0,My hemline has nothing to do with your Life's Purpose...only with the fees you're paying.
0,0,0,I keep waiting for a Freudian slip from you.
0,0,0,Tell me how you're feeling about the split.
0,0,0,While you do have appeal, your wife is asking, "What's on the inside?"
0,0,0,No, I'm not saying you're bananas, but you are on a very slippery slope.
0,0,0,When did you begin to feel you weren't top banana?
0,0,0,I'm telling you, I've gone bananas!
0,0,0,Lately I just feel like I am slipping.
0,0,0,It's going to be a while before you feel whole again.
0,0,0,Have you ever considered the possibility that they might be laughing **with** you?
0,0,0,It seems you have a banana split personality.
0,0,0,Stop with the Freudian slip jokes, already!
0,0,0,Everyone keeps stepping on me.
0,0,0,We need to connect you with your inner-self.
0,0,0,You don't seem happy to be seeing me.
0,0,0,So when did you split?
0,0,0,You shouldn't blame yourself that he slipped and broke his leg.
0,0,0,This is fruitless.
0,0,0,Last week you said it felt like everyone you love is slipping away.
0,0,0,No. Just leave it there or you'll give him all the power.
0,0,0,Say more about your 'wish for revenge' when people step on you.
0,0,0,Seriously? You're not "peeling" very well?
0,0,0,I know you split, but tell me how you really feel.
0,0,0,Tell me more about how you feel like a bruised shell of your former self.
0,0,0,And, then, he decided to make a smoothie.
0,0,0,Let's discuss this perception that your appeal is slipping, and you feel empty inside.
0,0,0,Is it possible she might just be clumsy?
0,0,0,So, Mr. Peel...you feel as if you are the butt of every joke...
0,0,0,Well of course everyone falls for you.
0,0,0,If I had to put a label on it, I would say you're bananas.
0,0,0,FREUDIAN SLIP. "I meant mucus, not musaceous. This is NOT about my family"
0,0,0,Yes, laughter is healthy, but not at the expense of others.
0,0,0,I had a terrible dream with mommies...I mean monkeys staring right at me
0,0,0,I have a recurring dream where I'm making everyone fall...
0,0,0,What makes you think that the political system is suffering from just a potassium deficiency?
0,0,0,So, you say that you find yourself slipping into depression?
0,0,0,You seem to bruise easily.
0,0,0,It's quite normal that sometimes you're just a banana.
0,0,0,No I dont like that word. How about I fantasize about you gliding on me from time to time.
0,0,0,we've got to stop seeing each other like this.
0,0,0,You need to quit being a fall guy.
0,0,0,When did you first realize that you had a foot fetish?
0,0,0,So...when your "I want to be a pair of slippers" joke didn't work, was that the start of your bruising period?
0,0,0,Bunch therapy just wasn't working.
0,0,0,Let's peel back the layers of your childhood
0,0,0,I’m not just slippery when wet.
0,0,0,How do you peel today?
0,0,0,I'm just a shell of the man I used to be, doctor..
0,0,0,'Torn apart...empty...discarded', let's explore what might lie behind that self-image.
0,0,0,So you were saying you used to be bananas?
0,0,0,Forgive yourself. You didn't intend for anyone to slip.
0,0,0,I no longer find you attractive. You are just skin to me now.
0,0,0,So, how long have you thought you were a plantain?
0,0,0,Tell me how you feel now that you are no longer top banana.
0,0,0,And how long have you had these feelings of emasculation?
0,0,0,Let's peel back some layers of memory...
0,0,0,Why is it only clutzes who fall for me?
0,0,0,What you're suffering from is a banana-split-personality.
0,0,0,It's not your fault the family is a bunch of losers
0,0,0,My life's become a joke, Doc.
0,0,0,I keep dreaming I'm an orange peel. Am I crazy?
0,0,0,And how did you feel when the heel hit you?
0,0,0,Can you go back to the part where you said you felt like your heart went through a blender?
0,0,0,no, I've never heard that one before
0,0,0,I understand. Plantains are getting all the attention lately. Get over it!
0,0,0,The bunch is lonely too.
0,0,0,At some stage we will have to move on from your feelings of being used only for a laugh and address your fear of peanut butter and bread.
0,0,0,Now un-peal your emotions for me.
0,0,0,So tell me, when did you start feeling so empty inside.
0,0,0,Based on what you told me about your mother, I'm afraid you've got what we call an edible complex.
0,0,0,Maybe this could be a painting!
0,0,0,You like split personalities. We know you do.
0,0,0,It sounds to me like people weren't laughing at YOU so much as they were laughing at the entire situation.
0,0,0,I'd like to address this extreme paranoia you have about ending up on Skid Row.
0,0,0,How long have you been experiencing these feelings of emptiness?
0,0,0,Maybe daylight has come and you can't go home anymore.'
0,0,0,Well, I'd call that a classic Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I was recommended by your friend the Orange?
0,0,0,The end of the session can be awkward. Oftentimes the analyst has to bear with her patient as he confronts the realization that he is not what he thinks he is.
0,0,0,"Orange who"?
0,0,0,Tell me about your survivor guilt.
0,0,0,You can't just hurt everyone that walks all over you.
0,0,0,This is how you feel once we have peeled back all of the layers.
0,0,0,Internal medicine is not my forte, but I believe your potassium level is slipping.
0,0,0,Sorry, I'm more of a plantain kind of woman.
0,0,0,How do you feel about the split?
0,0,0,Don't worry, you'll get stepped on one day.
0,0,0,You need to stop seeing yourself as the fall guy.
0,0,0,You have to quit blaming yourself. The accident wasn't your fault.
0,0,0,It's hardly egotistical for YOU to think about bringing Trump down.
0,0,0,Don't make me laugh!
0,0,0,How long have you had this desire to hurt people by having them slip on you on the pavement?
0,0,0,Looks like it's been an hour. Time for you to split.
0,0,0,"I asked if you had "Ben & Ann appeal"....!!!
0,0,0,So, any slip-ups since our last session?
0,0,0,Your guilt is from a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,I don't do "Freudian."
0,0,0,Tell me about your bunch of origin.
0,0,0,I just can't shake the feeling that my life has been nothing but a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I think it is narcissistic of you to think that everyone falls for you.
0,0,0,You want to peel what?
0,0,0,Maybe you need to establish other goals rather than trying to make people slip and fall.
0,0,0,How long have you felt like an avocado?
0,0,0,It sounds like it was a classic case of a Freudian slip-and-fall.
0,0,0,Well, you've certainly got appeal.
0,0,0,Your dreams about your mother stepping on you is what we call a Freudian slip.
0,0,0,You are on a slippery slope if you are suggesting that I used you for personal pleasure.
0,0,0,Don't give me the slip!
0,0,0,I'd like us to focus on your early relationship with the bunch.
0,0,0,It sounds to me like you have a split personality.
0,0,0,Someone steped on me but it was a "Freudian Slip".
0,0,0,When did you start having this feeling of emptiness?
0,0,0,You are gonna be paying for this couch too, you know.
0,0,0,Of course you feel 'empty inside.' Your life cycle is ending.
0,0,0,I hate that I always slip away from people.
0,0,0,You can't live your life just waiting for others to slip up.
0,0,0,Stop calling me Sugar, I'm Mr Cavendish to you.
0,0,0,Tell me again why you don't think your appealing.
0,0,0,Not feeling comfortable in your own skin is actually quite common, Mr Plantain.
0,0,0,I FIND YOUR THERAPY APPALL-ING. NO WAIT.
0,0,0,I feel like my whole life has become the punch line to a bad joke.
0,0,0,So, every time someone picks you, you feel the need to split?
0,0,0,You've opened up, but I'm concerned you're starting to push people away.
0,0,0,First thing's first: sit like a lady.
0,0,0,Do you find yourself appealing.
0,0,0,Anything you say about a slip and fall lawsuit will be strictly confidential.
0,0,0,Stop thinking you are a banana.
0,0,0,Why do you think you're sadistic?
0,0,0,Honestly...I'm just sick of sharing the chocolate with that cold hearted vanilla.
0,0,0,Now that I've opened up, I feel vulnerable.
0,0,0,When I told you last week to work on being more appealing to others, I didn't think you'd take me literally.
0,0,0,How have you been feeling, slick?
0,0,0,I'm not peeling well.
0,0,0,And when they are laughing, how does that make you feel?
0,0,0,Whether you were ripe enough is something we'll need to work on.
0,0,0,So you're feeling kind of left out of the whole smoothie scene, huh?
0,0,0,So . . . you're feeling a little empty inside?
0,0,0,So, what's been eating you?
0,0,0,What do mean your grasp of reality is slipping?
0,0,0,Today I want to focus on your fear of clowns.
0,0,0,What you've described here is textbook penis envy.
0,0,0,No, therapy is not a slippery slope.
0,0,0,I just keep peeling like people are afraid of walking near me.
0,0,0,In psychoanalysis we take slips seriously.
0,0,0,So, since the split you've felt empty?
0,0,0,So, how long have you not been peeling well?
0,0,0,Anyone who would turn himself into a banana peel is clearly nuts!
0,0,0,I just haven't felt appealing since we split....
0,0,0,How did it make you feel when Apple said that you had, 'gone bananas'?
0,0,0,And what do YOU mean by a Freudian Slip?
0,0,0,Doesn't tripping people seem like a passive-aggressive way of managing your feelings?
0,0,0,He didn't use his hands Rachel!
0,0,0,I just can't get over the split.
0,0,0,"Now that you've taken responsibility, you have to learn to forgive yourself".
0,0,0,I have always been mistakenly associated with a great number of slip accidents
0,0,0,I'm afraid our time is up. You'll need to split.
0,0,0,And when did you first become a vegan?
0,0,0,I'm flattered, but let's talk about what makes YOU appealing.
0,0,0,You feel stepped on?
0,0,0,It's like I got one foot already out the door.
0,0,0,I was born on a plantation, moved to Hollywood but then I slipped up.......now I'm just a second banana.
0,0,0,So you told him to stop monkey-ing around, and then what happened?
0,0,0,I feel used and discarded.
0,0,0,So when did you discover just how slippery Life can be??
0,0,0,No you're not paranoid you do make people slip up
0,0,0,A thick skin can be a slippery slope.
0,0,0,That reminds me- I also need to pick up nuts and maraschino cherries.
0,0,0,What do you think it means, this slippery slope you keep dreaming of...
0,0,0,So tell me, when did you feel things were slipping?
0,0,0,Yes, Plantain is bigger, but your sweeter.
0,0,0,Is that Freudian?
0,0,0,You seem to be going down a slippery slope.

0,0,0,They're not laughing at you, they're laughing with you.
0,0,0,I don't want you slipping back into old habits.
