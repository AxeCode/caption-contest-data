22,3,1,All this over a P & J sandwich.
16,9,1,Mind if we pull over for a potty break?

20,4,2,You'll never catch us alive!" "Shut up and rock, Wayne.
17,7,2,Well heckfire. They're gainin' on us and my gun's outta water.

16,8,2,Chasing crooks is just a hobby of mine.
26,1,0,I knew we should have taken the diesel powered horse.

14,6,4,I've got a squirt gun and I'm not afraid to use it!
14,9,1,First one to the swing set wins.
14,5,1,Because we're a one-horse town, and he stole the horse!
19,4,1,Well when a cowboy rides one, it is a real horse.
16,7,0,Don't worry, CGI will fix this.
11,9,6,We may look ridiculous, but we're still ahead of you.

10,8,4,These chases just aren't the same since PETA took over the studio!
13,7,2,Head to our hiding place behind the dollhouse!
17,4,2,This is retarded!
15,6,1,This race rocks.
17,7,2,Westerns just aren't the same in the age of PETA.
16,7,1,I'm out of dimes.
20,4,1,You outlaws have rocked the wild west for far too long now

12,9,2,I'm warnin' you Tex. I got me a water gun and I plan on using it!.
20,4,1,"The Wood, the Bad and the Ugly" A PETA original
18,3,0,You've got us between a rock and a hard place.
9,7,7,They're still a day's ride behind us.
13,6,4,Playtime's over, sheriff!
21,1,0,I am a sinner that does not expect forgiveness. But I am not a government official.
22,2,0,These rockers don't move like no rolling stone!
23,3,0,This sho' beats line dancing guys
14,9,3,They're gainin' on us! We're home free! They're gain in' on us! We're home free!...

21,1,0,If that's really Woody Carr, then we're in trouble.
22,3,1,They're catching up. Rock faster.
19,3,0,We ain't gots to really catches them.... Just makes it looks likes we're aiming to... Perception is reality.
24,2,0,Wrong. You cannot ride AND shoot.
14,8,4,I wish this thing has more horse power!
18,6,2,I thought we would have lost these guys by now!
15,6,4,Something about this lacks "true grit".
20,3,0,That wall that guys been talking about, I sure hope it's been built!
19,5,2,Eat my sawdust, Marshal.
21,4,0,We're the new era rockers!
24,1,0,That's right, Sam. We gonna rock it til the wheels fall off!
20,2,0,Grown ups at child's play; just hobby horsin' around
19,6,0,They're gaining on us! Wait, no. Hurry! We're getting away.
20,2,0,For the 99th time, who are those guys?
19,6,0,Next week we train on REAL horses!
19,3,2,And don't forget...I get the girl at the end!
17,6,2,And there's a carousel posse right behind them.
13,9,3,Head them off at the sandbox
15,9,2,Head for the toy department, Hank! We'll lose 'em there!
17,6,2,Copy cats!!!
21,2,0,I'm only in second gear and still have more horsepower than you! I'm glad I wore my spurs!! Yeehaw!!
13,7,5,PETA has gained far too much influence.
22,4,0,Manual warfare ain't what it used to be.
16,8,2,No wonder they're catching us. They've been rockin' around the clock!
17,6,3,This is like the senate.
16,3,5,Don't worry, the Indians are on Big Wheels.
18,5,0,If we shoot at 'em from this here distance…we can't hardly miss 'em!
19,2,1,Catch us if you can, losers" or "My last time working in a low-budget movie
24,2,0,We're from the Rockin' Ranch!
21,3,2,Rock ,rock as fast as you can ---You can't catch us we're the Ginger horsemen !!
19,5,1,Rock, Billy, rock! They're gaining on us!
22,1,0,"Rock on, but my new model rocks faster".
17,6,1,I think we can slow down, they ain't gaining on us.
12,8,7,Let's dismount and run for it.
17,6,1,We’ll leave you in the sawdust.
20,6,0,I told you we should use stick horses!
20,4,1,They're closing in on us. Those lawmen sure can rock a horse!
16,7,1,This isn't what I had in mind when I suggested wild west reenactments as a hobby.
18,5,1,TAKE TWO: Gentlemen, Try too make it look a little more realistic this time.
19,4,2,Stalemate?
14,8,1,All we stole was candy.
18,8,1,Jake, we're being followed!...but, they'll never catch us.
14,11,1,The key is to let the horse do the work.
22,2,1,I can't
21,2,0,Them's our hobby horses we rounded up!
21,3,0,Hold your horsies. I think we're going the wrong way.
14,4,3,careful sheriff, this here's no country for grown men!
13,8,3,I hope this looks better on the big screen
16,4,2,We're not going back to juvie!
22,3,1,This ain't no Jailhouse Rocker!
22,2,2,Them lawmen got no right to be that cute.
14,6,5,Next time, let's pay for a better dude ranch.
16,8,2,Quit chasin' us! It's supposed to be nap time.
17,5,1,For twenty years I've been hearing you say "We're gaining on 'em."
24,1,1,Is this the Apocalypse?
21,6,0,I don't care how much we saved, we are never using that cobbler again.
23,1,1,They're beginning to get on my nerves. Who are those guys?
14,7,5,The real criminals are the ones that sold us these horses.
18,5,2,Unless we get moving, they'll be on us by nightfall
19,6,1,Faster! They're packin' cap guns!
18,5,2,P.E.T.A.! Schmeeta! I am getting real sick of this P.C. crap!
14,5,4,These PETA folks are taking things too far!
13,11,2,You have no chance of catching us before the statute of limitations runs out.
23,2,1,Vegans rock!
23,2,1,Where's your posse, Poser?
21,3,1,We are making constant progress
15,11,0,No, I won't trade horses with you.
13,6,4,Fake horses and real guns - who wrote this, PETA and the NRA?
16,8,2,We're going nowhere fast.
16,7,1,Somehow it don't seem so wild anymore.
17,5,3,Hey, guys, I think mom is calling us in for dinner!
18,5,2,I knew we should've waxed our runners more
24,0,1,I thought it was a Bucking Bronco race, Not a Rocking Horse race!
16,9,0,We need a bigger budget!
9,13,3,If we get out of this one, I've robbed my last model train.
14,8,4,I don't think these spurs are working. We still haven't lost 'em.
19,4,0,I get it, Gary - I just don't see how this promotes teamwork.
22,2,1,Damn! That's Sheriff John 'Rocking' Holiday!
19,4,1,I don't care if it's cosplay -- it's analog and it's boring!
16,6,1,Rock-a-Bye, Baby!
23,2,0,Step on it Rider, they are gaining on us.
21,3,0,These are Rockers -- I thought you said "Texas Rangers"
15,7,3,I told you we should've taken the horses with springs.
24,1,0,The sheriffs always take the toy store too seriously.
18,5,1,They're still toying with us, Ned. I say we make a run for it.
13,9,1,Head for the electric train!
20,3,1,Aight Ma we will be inside in a few
22,2,1,Rockin' and not rollin' makes for a long chase, Sheriff.
16,9,1,We gotta hurry, Clem- these guys ain't playin' around...
22,0,1,We need a new lyric for "Old Rockin Chair"
25,0,0,Quit rocking the sharif is after us
20,3,1,...no, 'fun.' This is how the West is FUN!
19,2,2,Hurry their gaining on us!
17,6,0,There is no thrill in this chase!!!
18,2,6,It's been thirty years. Maybe it's time to give up the chase.
18,4,3,These will be edited in post, right?
17,2,1,Did yours come with a body cam?
19,3,3,Thank G-d for law enforcement cutbacks.
6,8,9,PETA is ruining this for everyone.
19,1,0,Heard on a movie set: "It looks dumb without a screen to hide the horses legs"
14,7,2,Can't we just shoot it out and call it a day?
14,6,0,These dudes take their games seriously.
12,8,5,Butch, we're not exactly losing em, but they're not gaining either.
10,10,3,Oh, what I'd give for a stick horse right now.
14,4,4,What gave me away as Billy the Kid?
19,6,1,You can look back, but for heaven's sake, don't lean back!
15,7,3,Use your spurs !!
23,1,1,Come on Earl! Keep on rockin' to free world!
25,2,0,Come on on guys, keep up!
14,6,2,Jeb, more rockin', Sheriff Arp's got a tailwind.
21,6,0,Ain't it ironic...we brought glue in case of a broken leg.
18,7,0,Seriusly, we actually picked the one state where horses are illegal?
23,1,1,I deserve to be punished.
21,4,1,Ride hard Pardner... the Law is closin fast on those Balsa Wood Ponies !!
23,3,0,Come on guys, we are about to catch the elephant.
16,10,0,They're gaining! No, they're not. They're gaining! No, they're not.
21,1,0,That's right, pod'ner, we rock in after the spaghetti western guys!
25,2,0,"But you promised I'd ride with Billy Crystal.
22,2,0,I betcha they don't consider it a Hobby!
18,7,1,Those other guys? They're off their rockers.
16,7,1,You know what really chaps my hide? Splinters.
13,8,3,Hurry up! They're almost within cap gun range!
16,6,3,Dang! We shoulda stole the Hot Wheels.
24,2,0,Great form, Dave! This new horse yoga sure beats hot yoga don't you think?
23,2,0,Hey Jeb, let's take these varmints out with our spud guns.
15,8,0,These budget cuts are getting ridiculous.
16,7,2,Something about them horses look familiar
19,3,1,Remind me to donate to an election campaign that backs strict constructionism. Only a sheriff that’s a judicial activist would broaden horse theft to include all horses. But you gotta admire them for living their principles.
23,2,1,Gun control movement was nothing compared to this.
21,4,0,Just like the good young times
16,9,0,Is stealin' rocking horses a hangin' offense?!
16,6,1,Can't you see we're just toys in someone else's game?
15,8,2,Doggone budget movies!
11,10,5,I knew we shouldn't have robbed that piggy bank!
22,2,0,These independent, low budget movies are just not my cup of tea Bradly
21,2,1,They're gaining on us better double time it!
22,2,1,Would you hurry up!? They're getting away!
20,4,1,Mr. Trump! The Republican Mainstream is still after us!
20,2,1,Where'd ja get YOUR Tesla horse?
26,0,0,Deputy, regarding catching drug dealers: anything not worth doing is not worth doing well.
11,10,5,Once I get to the merry-go-round you'll never catch me.
9,8,8,This is absolutely my last low-budget western.
17,5,1,I said to get us some BAY stallions, Clem, not EBAY stallions!
21,6,0,I stand corrected, Billy. The hobby horses would have been the more mobile purchase.
23,1,1,Hey Will, I think this is your hat.
19,5,0,No matter where you go No matter what you do I'll make it a point To rock harder than you
24,1,0,No more donut store robberies.
15,8,2,We will, We will Rock You.
13,9,5,Robbin' banks just ain't the same since PETA came along.
21,2,1,Relax sheriff, I can see the rocking horse ranch just ahead.
14,8,2,Whaddaya mean that's a real gun?!
18,3,3,Look on the bright side boys, no stalls to clean anymore!
21,1,0,We're OK if we can Red Shift them!
19,3,1,Get a new hobby!
20,2,2,I think our only chance to lose 'em is to dive into the ball pit.
13,8,4,Stop! Or we will, we will, rock you.
18,5,1,Whoopie ti yi yo kemosabe, who's got the dramamine?
12,11,1,We should be right about this same spot come nightfall.
23,2,0,Rock & roll on , you doggies, it's happy hour and we're heading for the Hard Rock Saloon !!!
19,4,0,You'll never catch us! Due to the curved shape of the rocking horse base and Newton's second law, every force has an equal and opposite force. So even if you push toward us, you will rock backward and not make any forward progress!
22,3,0,Rock on, Jim, they're a'gainin' on us!
10,13,1,Faster....they're gettin' close to pop-gun range!
15,6,0,You've probably never rocked this hard in your life, have you Sheriff.
17,4,0,Act like your hurrying. They think they're catching up!
20,1,1,You wouldn't be so close if these were REAL horses !
17,6,1,Wyatt, its Seven days later and they are only 2 inches closer when do you think they'll realize they can just walk over
22,2,1,I weckon weeah too fast faw ya, Shewiff Bwody!
20,4,0,Don't be fooled by the big-posse trick. They are just slappng their hands on their thighs.
13,8,4,So this is what my agent meant by "low budget western"!
18,5,2,Mine's a hybrid, How 'bout you?
13,13,1,They ain't gainin' on us, but we ain't losin' 'em either!
19,4,2,"I knew we shouldn't have rustled horses named 'Ol' Splinter' and 'Woodie' ".
21,3,0,Wait till Dad finds out you've been greasing the runners with his hair cream again.
18,5,1,They're gaining on us...I think.
16,5,3,Holding onto our hats sure does add to the illusion of forward movement!
18,3,2,Darn it, Sundance. One of the posse guys is mocking me. Everytime I touch my hat, he touches his.
19,5,1,Our kids are much better at this than we are !!
15,7,2,We should go for position. I'll shoot the Sheriff, but I will not shoot the deputy.
20,3,0,Get some wheels!
14,7,2,They're rocking on us.
23,0,0,Sheriff, are you wearing wig?
10,13,3,Looks like everyone's been hit by the budget cuts.
19,5,0,No, I'm serious, Sundance. It's Joe Lefors and Lord Baltimore, and they're gaining on us!
18,6,1,Every man needs a hobby.
21,3,2,Ever felt like you were between a hard rock and a place?
10,11,2,You're off your rocker if you think you can catch me.
21,5,0,We better forward and back...they are teetering on us.
22,1,2,We're done for. They have the new model.
20,4,1,But I didn't shoot the deputy!
14,11,2,Let's split up.
12,8,3,Giddy up before they knock us off our rockers!
18,6,1,Your cap gun shootin' ain't so good either, Sheriff!
13,8,1,'Tweren't us who done robbed the piggy bank!
18,3,1,when the horses go on strike
19,2,0,I wear a an extra large. This must be your small hat.
15,6,2,Wouldn't want to beat a dead horse!
19,7,0,....and you don't have to feed or groom 'em....just think....it'll save us a fortune!
12,10,2,We'll have a better chance of losing them if we split up!
15,8,3,Grow up!
19,3,2,Boy! The animal rights campaign sure has hit Hollywood!
19,6,0,Whoa, pardners! I'm think Ol' Sheriff Adams is off his rocker!
15,8,1,They're gaining, wait we are pulling away, nope they are gaining again.....
22,2,1,Hey sheriff, fyi, the Pi ratio of our rocking horses is identical, so it's virtually impossible for you to ever catch us.
15,9,1,Should've turned left at the monkey bars
21,3,1,But the green screen makes the movies safer for the actors.
18,6,0,Sir, I'm going to exercise my right to keep on rocking in the free world.
21,0,1,We'll be great again when we get there!
15,6,2,Sheriff, ain't "horse thief" an exaggeration?
21,4,0,I know accidents are down 50%, but I hate the simulator.
13,7,5,They’re gaining on us! We’re losing ‘em! They’re gaining on us! We’re losing ‘em! They’re gaining on us! We’re losing ‘em! They’re gaining’ on us! We’re losing ‘em!
13,9,3,What do you say we stop and water the horses ?
11,10,4,I don't know how, but they're gaining on us.
24,1,0,It's Woody Earp and Doc Woodson on they are riding some pine horses!
13,5,2,Their guns are toys also.
13,8,4,Give up already, Kasich...it's a two-horse race now!
17,7,1,Don't worry, Slim. They're still three feet behind us.
21,3,0,I think we can lose them at the merry-go-round or, with a little luck, the jungle gym.
20,5,1,I rockin they're gaining on us, Curtis!
11,6,5,These cutbacks are killing us
8,12,2,Damn, we should have grabbed the pogo sticks!
22,1,0,Trying to perfect riding the horsey is hard, so keep it up boys!
18,4,0,Get along 'lil teak wood
17,5,3,We can do this 'till the cows come home, but the distance won't ever change.
19,4,1,I said, GOOD DAY sir!
19,6,1,It's a photofinish!
19,3,2,Bad news, Butch. The law shops at the same store we just robbed.
22,1,3,You'll never catch me on a horse like that!
22,4,0,Ha ha. Charlie horse is always behind.
17,5,0,You boys better let go of them stolen horses..if you know what's good for you!
18,7,1,We might get caught, Jim, but at least we'll be carbon-neutral.
23,1,0,Hey, come back with those arcade tickets!
13,7,5,So they never tire. There were other things you should have considered.
15,7,1,We ain't goin back to yer Micky Mouse jailhouse sheriff...
18,4,3,But in my dream we got away.
20,4,0,Yes, times are tough, and we're only professional horse thieves, but shouldn't our ethics have some floor?
19,6,1,Just sayin', these self-driving cars got a way to go.
20,3,1,This sure chaps my hide.
17,7,1,No I don't have any Grey Poupon.
23,3,0,Dang it, we ain't the horse thieves!!
7,11,4,If you don't stop following us, I'm calling my mom!
19,3,2,They're gainin' on us, Buck - pretty soon we'll be in range of their water pistols.
19,4,0,They're right, Sheriff. We're all hat and no cattle.
20,4,0,Didn't I tell you we shouldn't have taken the EPA too lightly?
21,2,0,Better pound leather, Tex - they're slowly gaining on us!
17,5,3,Rock, Sukey! Rock like the wind!
19,6,0,Well guess who just rocked up!
23,1,0,The four horsemen of the cowboy trips.
18,4,1,I guess the fun and games are pretty much over.
18,5,2,Sheriff next time, we'll steal Pogo sticks.
13,9,1,Rock harder! They're gaining.
22,3,0,You'll never catch us, big tax-credit lawmen.
15,7,3,...and the horse you came in on, too!
15,4,4,...and for your information, sometimes a bandanna is just a bandanna!
17,6,2,Hurry! We need to shift out of rock and into roll.
17,7,2,We gotta get fresh horses!
13,6,3,Just make sure you crop the bottom a bit before you post it.
19,4,3,They've got the speed, but we've got the brains.
21,3,1,I told you President Trump would think we're losers and cut our funding
9,7,10,For goodness sake, it was only a piggy bank!
16,6,3,Good work, fellas - my pedometer shows we've covered twenty-two miles since sunrise.
18,5,2,Go ahead and shoot, we're all carrying cap guns.
20,3,0,If we continue at this speed, they’ll never catch us.
15,9,1,Aw shucks sheriff, ain't it nap time yet?
14,10,0,Alright Trigger, if you don't out run these guys you are going to the wooden pencil factory !
19,4,1,You'll never catch us riding those nags!
20,3,1,They're still gaining on us!
23,3,0,Be patient, Virtual Reality "The Magnificent Seven" 1.1 will be available on Amazon in 2 weeks.
16,4,2,My horse is running as an Independent. What's yours?
15,5,2,So, that's where Billy the Kid gets his name!
21,4,0,You'd think the IRS should have more important things to do.
13,7,3,This is what happens when I rob a piggy bank.
12,9,3,This is just a hobby.
23,2,1,Down the backstretch, here comes Lonesome Dove.
18,5,1,I think I prefer the ones made of solid mahogany.
18,7,1,Just wait until I get my hands on those varmints who stole our horses!
17,8,1,We should've robbed a car dealer instead of a toy store.
15,4,6,You know, Tex, this class fulfills my inner cowboy in a way that SoulCycle never did.
23,3,1,Quick, head for the Rockies!
23,3,0,Donald Trump's hair is after us!
20,3,1,Looks like they're fighting fire with fire!
15,8,4,Las’ time I let you git the horses.
16,7,2,I think these animal cruelty laws are going to far!
17,7,1,Faster Zeke, they're gaining on us!
12,11,1,We've gotta hang on until mom gets home!

21,2,2,Hey Steve, I don't think I want to play anymore.
21,4,1,Think of the money your saving on feed and vets.
17,7,2,Are you off your rocker? They're gaining on us.
19,5,1,Maybe it's the wind but I just don't feel like we're making any headway.
14,9,3,I told you to grab the ones with wheels.
18,5,4,Trust me pardner, chafing is only half of our problem.
18,6,0,Faster! We gotta shake 'em!
11,6,4,I think we lost them – unless of course they ditch the horses and walk over to us
21,2,3,Rock on, dammit!
21,4,0,Let's see how you do up this hill!
15,4,1,How much farther to the playroom?
16,6,1,These vintage spin classes rock!
15,10,0,Didn't you say that if we outlawed horses, outlaws would still have horses?
16,6,3,I don't know about you guys, but I'm definitely firing my agent.
18,4,3,These new eco-friendly rides don't really have the giddy-up I was hoping for.
19,5,0,The chase scene called for live horses.
17,2,0,(this is still for the contest that ends on March 20th; and I am in time!!!) "It looks like it will be a long case."
22,4,0,Just be glad it's not a sloppy track.
25,0,0,Faster, Dakota's on our tail!
18,7,1,We had a smaller budget than Tarantino for this one.
22,3,1,Faster. Good guys really rock !
22,1,1,Rash cam video don't lie
19,4,2,Jed, the termites ain't workin'!
16,9,0,Don't worry. They're not gaining up on us any more than they were two hours ago.
23,3,1,You head for Jack-in-the-Box canyon, Butch, and I'll try to out-rock the posse!
18,5,3,They're gaining on us!
15,6,1,I don't know about you Sheriff, but I think we may have missed nap time.
16,7,0,What do ya mean, We ain't going nowhere?
12,8,3,That's the last toy store I'll ever rob!
20,2,3,I reckon it's time to make 'em eat some caps!
16,6,1,Wait, time out guys. Splinter.
18,7,1,The wind is against us!
16,6,1,My therapist will have a field day with this one -- at least I'm dressed!
22,2,0,To think I gave up collecting stamps for this.
20,0,2,Looks like this arms race has broken them, too!
19,3,1,These may be horses, but all I see is four jackasses.
21,4,0,Teacher says recess is almost over!
19,2,2,Dang! That chestnut the sheriff's ridin' is awful fast!
17,4,1,We ain't goin' to jail, Bart; sheriff's playin' by our rules now.
19,5,1,It's only a mockery of justice if we don't catch you !
18,4,1,Head for the nursery----it's almost bed time
12,9,4,When suburban mommas let their babies grow up to be cowboys...
13,10,1,Do not confuse motion and progress sheriff.
23,1,0,I am trying to look more presidential.
13,7,3,Looks like the Sheriff's not off his rocker anymore.
19,1,2,It was either these or the Bouncy Castle.
18,6,0,We ain't gonna win the West this way.
12,6,2,Let's just settle this in a manly way.Squirt guns at ten paces.
18,6,2,Hey, Rex, my GPS is indicating we haven't moved a bit.
19,4,2,Make a run for the pedal cars.
16,9,1,Yet another great American tradition that PETA has managed to neuter.
20,1,1,Is it something we should have learned in preschool?
16,10,1,Whatcha reckon we settle this like men?
18,6,0,I can't tell if they're gainin' on us.
18,6,0,No hoofbeats, .....merely the ceaselessly rocking into the alluring lore and mystique of the outlaw.
15,7,0,... If our guns weren't toys too, one of us could end this embarrassing spectacle.
12,10,4,But it was just a piggy bank!
17,6,0,'Cause I'm the sheriff and it's MY birthday.
12,11,1,We're not giving up without a temper tantrum!
19,2,2,The East Coast version
12,8,3,I told you this movie was underfunded.
21,2,0,OK! OK! We'll never steal from your corral again.
19,3,3,I told you we shouldn't have taken the white bronco.
15,7,1,Hold on to your hats; it's going to be a bumpy night.
20,2,0,I said this horse thievin' up would be child's play, not easy.
18,3,3,Don't shoot -- the bullets are fake, too.
18,8,0,Give it up, Black Bart. We aim to chase you to the ends of...uh...this here pasture!
21,3,1,One more move and I'll rock!
21,5,1,We lose 'em in the pass, then we'll head to Pappy's. He works miracles with splinters.
20,2,0,Howdy fella, you heading to the Bundy's too?
16,8,1,Okaaay. Simon says, 'Use both hands.'
23,2,0,You'll not live to see me hang, Pinkerton!
20,6,0,Talk about an exercise in futility.
23,1,0,Do these vehicles qualify for the car pool lane?
16,3,3,I must have been off my rocker. I never should have entrusted a PETA member with rounding up the horses for our escape.
16,4,2,It's a bad carpenter who blames his tools, Leroy
18,7,0,I think I prefer Louis L'Amour to D.H. Lawrence.
24,0,0,I told you, gun control doesn't work.
23,2,1,'Rockin' in a Free World' my ass!
23,3,1,You've got cooties!
16,8,1,They are too far ahead. We will never catch them.
16,5,4,The're gaining on us... We're loosing them. The're gaining on us... We're loosing them.The're gaining on us... We're loosing them.
17,7,1,"Next year we pay up and go to a dude ranch with real horses"!
15,8,2,I would have enjoyed this more when I was eight years old!
16,4,3,Careful, we're entering rock country.
23,3,0,We're not alone, and it's more like "Hi-OW sliver!"
17,7,2,Don't worry, they'll fix it in CGI!
15,6,3,They're gaining on us... oh, wait, it just appears that they're gaining on us.
18,6,1,We've been chasing them since kindergarten. But never give up!
15,7,2,Hurry up! My quarter's almost running out!
17,5,3,This is the last year we'll let HR plan our executive retreat activities.
14,7,2,They don't call me Billy the Kid for nuthin'.
15,11,0,You might as well quit now, two more feet and we're out of your jurisdiction.
23,2,1,You'll never catch us, Sheriff! These are Italian Stallions!
16,6,3,I realize it's a low-budget Western, but couldn't they have skimped on wardrobe instead?
18,3,2,You'll never catch us, sheriff!
17,7,1,Dagnabit! He almost catches us then he doesn't. He almost catches us than he doesn't. I don't get it!?
13,8,2,Rock faster! I think they're gaining on us!
22,1,0,We've never even heard of Human Growth Hormone!
15,7,2,Hate to say I told you so, but you should have gotten EZ Pass!
18,2,4,Sheriff, I wonder if that's them rich Rockin'feller's we keep hearing so much about....
21,2,2,Zeno says you'll never catch us.
15,8,1,This made more sense when we were kids.
26,0,1,No, not to the gravesite. They're cremating the old man's Stratocaster, too.
21,5,0,Save your energy boys. This is a two horse race.
19,4,1,Mom! Tell Eric and his friend to stop copying us again!
16,7,0,Don't worry Steve, due to budget cuts, they're only rocking mules.
14,7,3,Howdy! Enjoying the new ethical rodeo?
24,2,0,Don't worry, their horses are hybreds, we have more power.
20,4,1,We're not giving up unless we get a butt full of splinters.
16,8,1,Looks like we picked the wrong horses.
20,5,0,They're gainin' on us, Wyatt!
16,5,2,Sheriff, get off your high horse cause we ain't no bank rockers!!
14,8,2,How the west was fun.
16,8,3,Slim, curse this dang oak! They got the light cedar.
8,9,5,It feels like they're toying with us
14,8,4,Curse these budget cuts…
23,4,0,Shouldn't have gotten these horses from the "stable".
12,11,0,This ain't nothing. Ya'll should try the spinning class.
11,8,4,I sure hope this scene looks better in post-production.
16,5,4,I thought you sawed their legs
15,7,2,We may be going nowhere fast but their gaining on us!
17,5,3,PETA went after you guys too?
21,4,0,The cows are fairly easy to lasso.
18,4,0,It retrospect, maybe we should have asked for the Rocky Mountain Horse.
17,5,2,GOP Establishment falling behind.
24,1,0,You rock my world!
13,10,2,Don't worry. We'll lose them at nap time.
23,2,0,Dagnabbit, John, I told you we shoulda let 'em rest longer!
18,5,0,Billy the Kid's got nothin' on us!
19,5,2,It's not horse thiev'n sheriff, its even PETA compliant!
19,3,0,There a might ways back, but gaining. Put the spurs to her before they overtake us.
14,7,2,That was the wrong piggy bank to rob.
16,4,3,For the last time -- we are not horse thieves!
21,4,0,Dang! We should've stolen the hobby horses!
21,4,0,And this is what we get for making train robbery a hobby.
19,5,1,This is why we keep a BB in the chamber, Deputy.
17,5,2,I knew this O.K. Corral reenactment camp sounded too good for the price.
19,2,2,They're getting away! I told you cutting the transportation budget so we could afford fancier hats wasn't a good idea.
21,4,1,Well, they ain't a-gainin,' but we shore ain't outrunnin' 'em neither.
16,7,0,Just one question--are those water pistols?
18,4,1,Remind me -- are we the good guys or the bad guys?
22,4,0,That's the last time you'll talk me into buying the cheaper horses 'cuz they don't eat'.
22,2,0,Hey, Billy. We're not getting anywhere on these.
19,6,0,"You'll never catch us on those old wooden nags".
25,0,1,Consarnit! This ain't horseplay anymore.
17,6,1,Wow, sheriff, you ROCK!
19,3,1,I told you there wasn't any money in Westerns
18,5,3,If you say 'giddy-up' one more time I'll shoot you.
24,0,0,Hope there are some Steaks left...
23,4,0,Hey, at least we don't have to feed them.
15,8,2,We don't want to play with you guys anymore!
16,8,0,I said "rocket," not "rock it."
20,5,1,There must have been confusion when the wranglers were told Billy the Kid needed horses.
22,3,0,Budget cuts: what an efficient way to catch the bad guy
11,9,1,You had to sign us up for the BEGINNER'S Dude Ranch?!?
22,3,0,Drat! Caught in another speed trap -- It's the damn' sheriff's hobby-horse
20,4,1,You've been playing this game too long, old man!
23,1,0,Maybe we misread 'Rocket'!
22,0,0,You've rocked far, but soon I'll beat the stuffing out of ya!
22,4,0,These horses ain't movin, rock faster!
12,6,7,You boys up for discussin' the insolubility of this paradox?
25,0,0,You’ll never catch me, coppa – crime does pay!
20,4,3,Now I see why the sheriff's nickname is Rocky!
18,8,1,Hurry! We can lose them in the ball pit canyon.
14,8,4,Mom and Dad sent you, didn't they?
21,3,2,When I told the sheriff we needed some artificial intelligence to help solve the case, I didn't mean this.
19,3,0,Just follow your GPS!
21,3,2,The crappiest cowboy dream I ever had
13,9,2,Being a desperado is mighty tough since PETA came to town.
18,9,0,Let's rock.
17,4,4,I think we can outrock them.
23,3,1,Trump for President!!
18,5,3,You must be off your rocker!
13,12,2,Rock faster, they're gaining on us!
17,9,0,Catch up. Rock harder!
13,7,5,We'll be okay so long as they don't dismount and start walking after us.
17,3,2,Dang. They got studded rockers.
22,0,1,Isn't there something more important than the horse race?
16,4,4,Ya gotta be off yer rocker if ya thinks yer gonna ketch us!!
17,6,2,PETA has gone too far this time. This is the last low budget western I'm doing!
24,0,0,Don't come a-chasin' cause this horse ain't a-racin.
13,8,5,Dang, my water pistol's empty
16,5,2,Let's split off and see if we can lose them.
16,3,3,I thought you were off your rocker !
18,3,1,You'll never catch us, Rockers!
22,4,0,Steed Will Rock You
19,6,2,This is the Republican race in a nutshell.
15,10,1,Back off - I have two BBs with your names on them.
17,3,0,You're forgetting I'm the only one who knows where the sawdust hole is.
16,8,0,I said let's go to the Rocky Mountains on those horses in the distance! Now we're on rocky horses with the mountains in the distance!
21,4,1,Do they still hang you for horse stealing?
21,6,0,You're gonna spend a stretch in the time-out room for this Kid!
16,3,6,This is the last low budget movie I work on
16,6,4,I thought you meant your "hobby" was horseback riding!
23,1,0,Hurry, the sun setting won't last forever!
18,5,0,If we don't hurry, they could catch us before nap-time.
16,6,2,For the last time, I did not take that candy from that baby!
11,11,2,C'mon, all this over a piggy bank!
21,3,0,Dang it, Huck. Reckon we can't plead insanity in these here parts.
21,2,0,Let's rock 'n roll!
18,5,1,We'll just wait out the statute of limitations.
17,6,1,Nobody told us riding in the desert on a horse with no name is illegal.
19,4,0,You'll never, never catch me dead or alive.
16,6,4,First the Feds take away our guns, then our horses...
21,4,0,We just wanted to rock around the clock.
23,0,1,Now Volkswagen has gone too far.
17,7,1,Some things just never make sense.
23,2,0,I thought you meant Butch and Sundance, not Holly Hobby !?!
21,4,2,This Cowboys and Indians thing is starting to feel childish
20,5,1,Eat our little clouds of dust lawmen.
9,9,5,This is my first low-budget film.
16,6,4,I wish to hell these weren't toy guns!
20,4,2,You may have not have noticed we just crossed the border.
21,0,0,You'll never catch these white broncos.
14,7,4,This is absolutely positively the last movie I make with this studio!
21,3,0,But there isn't ANY posted speed limit out here, Sheriff.
21,2,1,We gotta hurry ! Our two-year-olds are after us !
16,6,3,Hey! I shot you! No fair! Mom!
18,4,4,I think De Blasio has taken this horse thing too far
16,6,2,If they get off their horses we're cooked.
16,7,3,We're not switching, I was sheriff all yesterday.
25,1,0,I won't stand another day of this! You little monster! Wish me into the cornfield, Anthony!
17,3,3,You'll never catch us. We rock AND roll!
20,3,1,Thee horses really rock!
12,10,3,Yeah, well ours don't have to stop for water either!
22,3,0,When you said 'Hard Rock', I thought we were goin' out to dinner.
15,7,2,They're catching up. Let's rock 'n roll.
18,6,1,Damn low budget Westerns.
15,7,1,Dang hybrids! They ain't near as good as our old hay-guzzlers!
16,7,3,Last time I'll rob a daycare center.
13,9,2,Speed up, he's riding a thoroughbred mahogany!
15,8,1,Heck, sheriff, can't you tell we ain't them horse thieves?!
18,6,1,Last one to Chuck E. Cheese is a rotten egg!
19,3,3,Can't we put our petty differences aside and focus on the horse thieves?
22,4,0,Did you get the email? They just banned Super Glue.
15,9,1,Does anybody else get the feeling we're not moving?
16,9,0,I've never had saddl sores but I've had plenty of splinters
20,4,0,And your mother wears army boots!
16,7,2,Is it just me or is there something Sisyphean about this?
17,6,2,Head for Mexico before the wall goes up!
23,2,0,You were spot on, Gary - worth every penny - I don't feel stupid at all.
21,5,0,I knew there was something fishy about getting horses through mail order.
24,2,0,Is this why they say that men never grow up?
18,6,2,Posse's gainin', but we'll outrun 'em. There's a fresh seesaw waitin' at the pass.
14,7,4,You're after the wrong guys! We're not real horse thieves. This is just a hobby!
18,3,2,This is the second-time we've passed 'em. Who are those guys?
15,6,2,They're gainin' on us. Rock faster!
21,3,1,What – squeak – did – squeak – you – squeak – say?
16,7,0,Ma said to quit pickin' on us!
20,5,2,Splinter?
19,5,1,I wish you'd told me what these spinning classes were like
15,5,5,Sure, it all seems bogus - until you check out the numbers on your Fitbit.
15,8,4,I always wondered why they called you Billy the Kid.
15,5,2,You're not going anywhere...
15,8,1,Told you we should have gotten here earlier for the spin class!
23,1,0,When your game of cops and robbers goes a little too far...
20,5,0,At least we look good riding them.
23,1,0,Darn these hybrids, no acceleration they are gaining on us!
20,1,1,Relax, Curly. They only got them recycled-by-firemen horses.
15,6,0,Consarn it, Tex, it looks like the marshal is tryin' to cut us off at the past!
20,4,2,They let hybrids into this race? What kind of horsepower can they possibly have?
19,6,1,Hold your horses. We only took wooden nickels.
20,3,2,Y'all mind if we give SoulCycle a try?
16,5,2,They’re gaining and also receding on us!
24,1,1,You are not going any were
22,3,0,It's no use Sheriff, we bought the turbo upgrade.
16,8,2,Stop or I'll get off and run after you.
21,3,1,I wish you knew how to quit me!
19,3,1,Damn the horse lobby !
18,2,4,Keep ridein', they'll soon tire of eatin' our sawdust.
20,5,2,Give it up, Sheriff! You'll never catch us!
18,7,0,Are the guns fake too?
21,3,0,With no water in sight, I don't know how long I can outrun these guys.
17,8,1,We need more horsepower!
8,14,4,I just hate these low budget Westerns!
14,10,2,We have to slow down. It's a preschool zone.
17,6,3,Don't they get tired? Don't they get hungry? Don't they get splinters?
18,7,1,I reckon this should keep PETA off our backs
8,10,4,We'll cut 'em off at the sandbox.
21,6,0,Face it, we rock harder than anyone!
19,2,1,I wasn't quite sure what to expect when you said "let's go western style ice skating" but this definitely wasn't it.
17,4,1,It's the goddamn Rocky Mountain police.
21,3,0,Rock on, Garth - they're a gainin' on us!
26,0,0,They didn' tell us 'bout no dang limitah at the dealahship!
22,2,0,And we'll whip your butt in 'Johnny on the Pony' as well!
13,10,3,Catch me or not, I ain't nappin!
14,4,2,My daughter would know what to do
18,3,0,Rocket it pal, they're catchin' up!
17,3,1,As I figure it, at this pace they'll never catch us.
25,0,0,No, sheriff - I DON'T wanna which to Barbie, Etch-A-Sketch, or Tickle-Me-Elmo.
16,7,2,We can trade hats, but we're still playing the bad guys.
17,5,3,My wife thinks I'm off my rocker for doing this.
18,6,0,Time to break out the cap guns.
19,5,2,Dang, I knew we shoulda got the ones with wheels!
22,2,0,Dang, they're a catchin' us!
22,3,0,Summer school for cowboy dropouts
18,6,2,Good call, Sheriff-- these are a lot faster than the merry-go-round horses.
15,8,3,You may have the law on your side but we got physics on ours!
16,8,0,There are worse things than a wild goose chase, sheriff.
19,2,1,Lets head'em off at the pass.
22,1,1,What! We ain't bronies, sheriff.
25,1,0,As he bites the dust.
21,2,0,You'll never catch us with just those plain old delegates.
13,9,2,Since when is being "off your rocker" a crime !!
22,3,0,Nananana boo boo.
23,3,0,This is Rockabilly.
20,4,1,Told you Toys R Us had the faster horses...
20,2,1,Next time I'm picking the ranch.
21,5,0,I can't go any faster. I'm getting splinters in my behind.
16,5,1,Next bank robbery we're using the getaway car!
17,4,3,You'll never rock in this town again.
15,8,1,These new horse safety laws are killing my outlaw vibe.
19,4,1,They're gainin' on us Cleetus, keep rockin'.
11,9,4,I think our producer is running out of money.
15,9,1,Sorry, sheriff, but at that rate you'll never catch us before beddy-by.
21,3,0,I wish you were a real horse! I wish you were a real horse! I wish you were a real horse!
25,0,0,Keep rocking, you may catch us eventually
19,5,0,Dad told me I'd never get anywhere in a rock band.
17,5,2,30 minutes and we still haven't reached the front yard!
18,5,1,C'mon you dudes, we have 500 miles to Denver, then comes the hard part.
16,5,4,Do we look as stupid as they look ?
10,10,4,Next time, you grab the cash and I'll get the horses!
20,6,0,I'm outa here they're off their rocker
23,3,0,Hey Bullock, if you see it rockin, don't come a knockin
18,6,0,I don't know Billy, seems like we've been riding for hours and they still aren't gaining on us.
20,1,2,No way those rockers catch our rockers!
16,5,2,We'll make our getaway when they have nap time.
16,4,2,Think they can beat "The Kid" at his own game?
19,6,0,What were we thinking with the water guns?
22,3,1,Bang! Bang, bang!
11,9,4,Calm down, Sheriff! It's just a hobby!
20,3,2,I told ya! We should've taken the Tonka.
25,1,0,Clearly our AI horses are faster than yours!
20,5,0,Tarnation! The hobby posse is rockin' some fresh mounts!
15,8,1,Hey, how come we're all wearing white hats!?
21,2,1,Hey, didn't you hear the director yell, 'Whoa!'?
17,5,4,Hurry we can lose them in the rockies!
23,1,0,Which way to the Hall of Fame?
19,4,3,You and your brilliant "cheap dude ranch" idea!
22,2,0,My kids rocking horse is better than your.
21,0,2,We should have taken the Cozy Coupe.
17,4,5,We better hightail it back to the toy store before they call a real sheriff.
18,3,0,Yippie! The horsepower increase is really noticeable -- glad we rigged those emission control tests!
15,6,4,Giddyup! Giddydown! Giddyup! Giddydown!
17,8,0,I thought I told you to grease the runners before we hit that bank!
9,10,5,Can't we settle our differences like adults?
24,0,0,Warp rock it partner, they're gaining on us.
18,3,2,"I'm getting a strong sense of deja vu".
17,5,0,They're still about two rocks behind us.
