22,3,2,Do you think he knows there's a water fountain inside?
23,3,1,This is part of his process. His best ideas come to him in the form of a desert mirage. Right now, he's a little blocked.
24,2,2,He's helping us test for a new kitty litter product

19,6,3,I don't say anything anymore. It seems to give him purpose.
22,4,3,I think I lost my boyhood somewhere over here.

24,4,1,He should see the oasis any second now.

23,6,0,He was a legionnaire. He's training for a marathon.
24,3,2,He's a performance artist... whatever the hell that is.

27,1,0,We use a sandbox for our code AND our coders.
24,3,1,He's trying to go back to where it all began.

22,1,2,His boss said more play in the sandbox would improve his performance.

23,3,2,Did we forget to dig him out last week ?
23,3,0,Mom said the Condo Board made him get rid of his camel.
22,3,1,Just another old guy trying to navigate the social media of a younger generation.
25,3,1,They call him the Catnip Cowboy.
29,0,0,When is dad gonna let us use the beach?" "I dunno. I think he's lost at virtual sea...
28,0,0,Did he just finally take his head out of the sand?" "Yes. He heard Bernie Sander's speech and it woke him up.
19,5,2,Next thing you know they will want our coloring books
22,4,1,I don't know what he's been looking for all day, but I'm pretty sure he has low expectations.
22,5,2,He voted Trump.
20,5,3,Thinking outside the sandbox was never his strong suit.
20,5,1,'Before it's too late, maybe tell him we have his pail and shovel?"
25,1,3,Usually it's cats.
24,3,1,Why does he keep saying "oil futures"?
26,2,1,Mom has suspended my dad's "adult privileges".
21,7,1,It's good to see my dad finally getting better after the divorce.
24,4,1,I just want to feel like a kid again.
25,3,1,These new Eco friendly condo amenities need to have time limits
27,1,0,His therapist has him doing this exercise every morning at this time; he'll be done in a few minutes.
24,2,0,There's water here, somewhere
23,4,0,Bad behavior or performance art?
24,3,0,He's just waiting for rain to make the perfect sandcastle.
24,5,0,if things go as planned , that's where I hope to be in thirty years
25,3,1,Remember when you asked me to explain a 'hot mess'?
21,7,1,So the faux desert is the new plunge pool?
20,4,2,Can't explore the Gobi on a teacher's pay, dude!
26,1,0,So this is the big idea behind these hot yoga classes, huh honey? "Well, they did say space was limited.
20,6,1,It's one of those new infinity deserts.
19,7,2,Actually, Eric, before Moms and Dads went with Madoff, we used to vacation in Palm Beach
20,6,1,So much for the family staycation.
24,2,0,He prepped for 40 years, but the stuff never did hit the fan.
26,3,0,Maybe it's true that the age of adulthood keeps going up.
20,4,0,He really missed seeing the mirages.
23,5,0,He's been like this since Kobe retired.
24,1,1,He's got an audition for the New Yorker tomorrow.
25,3,0,I heard, he's hidden away millions for when he gets out.
23,6,1,Let's give him another ten minutes. If he's not dead by then, we can find another sandbox.
22,6,0,Tell me again why we volunteered to keep the sandbox clean.
26,3,0,Remember, opening Cat Box Enterprises was your idea.
25,2,0,Dad started doing this when Mom get a job offer in Chicago.
26,2,0,If he passes the endurance test, we'll give him a job at 'The New Yorker' as a cartoonist.
25,2,0,Over Dramatic Jim missed happy hour.

23,4,0,Better than crossing the Sahara.

20,7,2,We're still not sure how this "species-neutral" bathroom is going to play out.
26,1,0,He refused the best offer for his property.
24,3,1,I think he lost his mind
21,5,2,Exactly when did he lose his keys in there?
26,3,0,There's not a lot of places in the city where you can re-enact Lawrence of Arabia.
21,4,1,He's rehearsing; he got a part in the Lawrence of Arabia remake.
19,5,3,He lost his keys downstairs, but there's more light up here.
19,6,3,It's been like this ever since the method acting school moved next door.
17,8,3,We should have called ahead for a reservation.
15,7,5,What we need is a buzzard.
15,12,1,I say we wait him out.
25,4,0,Should we tell him it's a litter box and that we weren't digging for gold?
25,2,1,He's must be hallucinating. What's an "Oasis"?
19,6,4,The only thing worse than cats using your sandbox are performance artists.

25,3,1,Johnson never could think outside the box.
21,5,1,Where are some buzzards when you need 'em?
22,5,2,If it's just a needle, my mom has thousands.
23,5,0,Poor Sandy. He never could think outside the box.
26,1,1,You know he's drunk, so I sure hope he doecn't think he's in a litterbox!
24,4,0,When are these darn poppies going to start to grow?
21,4,2,Do you think we should offer him a Perrier?
18,9,1,He rented this sandbox as an affordable alternative to the Burning Man Festival.
27,2,0,"Dad missed his interval training session at the gym today!
18,4,4,It may be too late for Uncle Ed to have that happy childhood.
28,1,0,Grandma told him to go to The Deck and get the sandwiches there.
20,6,3,Take Your Dad to Play Day is just wrong.
24,2,1,He lost it again.
20,8,0,Drat, he's no further than he was yesterday.
26,2,0,I just can't get used to "living sculpture", but I'm glad this one is plein aire.

27,1,0,Father was not kidding when he said we were moving to a building he considered an "oasis" right in the heart of Manhattan.
19,7,3,I think I like Dad better when he's on the wagon.
22,5,1,I forgot dad has an audition today.
16,9,1,I really hope we don't have to use this shovel and pail.
22,3,2,What worries me is that you never know what the consistency will be.
22,5,0,... it looks more like you buried his dignity.
24,2,1,I went out and got a peasant for our castle.
23,2,2,That guy needs to learn to drink outside the box
22,5,1,He sure doesn't play well in the sand box.
25,0,2,It's the new Bikram
22,5,1,When mom puts him out, dad prefers the cat's box to the dog's house.
25,3,0,Sandbox nothin'. It's a shelter for New York's homeless, donated by Saudi Arabia.
23,3,2,Maybe WE'RE just a mirage.
18,7,1,How long has your dad been preparing for Survivor?
23,4,0,Grownups need to play act rather than play.
19,6,3,Let's play outside the box today.
22,4,0,No bucket. No spade. What else can he play?
27,2,0,These pollsters are getting desperate.
25,1,1,I'm calling it , Lost Metal Detector
21,6,1,He says he's trying to overcome a traumatic kindergarten sandbox incident.
21,5,1,Ironic, perhaps, but wouldn’t a bucket and shovel compromise the integrity of his message?
23,4,0,I call it 'The Future'. The sand is made of crushed participation trophies.
17,9,1,You don't have to be out of the box to think outside of it.
26,2,0,I thought the pool would be finished by now.
16,9,3,His GPS is down.
18,5,2,Great. It's the "Occupy Sandbox" movement.
21,7,0,Told you we should've built an oasis!
21,8,0,Grown-ups have trouble thinking outside the box.
25,2,0,No, that is not Cat Man.
24,3,1,calls himself Indy and that he's looking for some ark.
19,5,4,Did you tell him we've found the shovel?
23,4,1,Just stick a potted plant & a bucket of water over there. Maybe he'll think it's an oasis!
19,7,2,We should teach him to think out of the box...
23,3,0,I think he's headed for the wading pool.
24,2,1,I don't wanna play with him.
24,3,0,If he doesn't find that water he's talking about in five minutes, our recess is over !
26,1,0,He says he's playing something called 'Escape from ISIS,' and as soon as he reaches the oasis, it's our turn.
25,2,0,Go get a bigger heat lamp. We've got a cold one, Martha
24,4,1,And the apartment rooftop includes access to a private beach.
25,4,0,My dad needs it more than we do... he can't afford a beach vacation
23,5,1,He's a thirsting artist.
17,2,6,Same guy who nearly drowned in my wading pool.
19,6,2,Ok mister. It is our turn to train for immigrating to Mexico if Trump becomes president.
20,2,3,I don't have the heart to tell him that's the buildings' litter box
25,1,0,It's a fascinating technique -- he uses an ammonia-based liquid to get it to stick together so well.
26,2,0,I think he's taking this Power Animal thing too far
23,6,0,Art is so strange these days.
24,3,0,They ran out of bonsai trees so he went with the mini desert.
21,5,0,Let's help him dig for water.
23,5,0,And we thought yesterday's cat was a problem.
17,10,1,'Looks like there's a scheduling conflict."
26,1,0,Don't worry, we just have to wait until he figures out we're part of his hallucination.
23,3,2,He's been doing laps all morning.
21,6,1,Guy in 14C. He binge-watches castaway movies.
23,4,0,He was in the French Foreign Legion. This reminds him of when he was young.
22,3,0,I think he wants to make sure no cats have been here.
21,6,0,If you build it, they will crawl.
23,5,0,I don't want to play "Death Valley" today.
22,5,1,It's OK. My drunk uncle thinks he's a cat.
25,1,2,Mom! Sahara Joe's in our sandbox again!
24,4,0,He's up for the lead in a remake of Lawrence of Arabia.
22,5,2,O.K. You've made your point about global warming.
27,1,0,Opps dad, I am sorry my took a bit longer than expected to drop me off after her shopping
26,3,0,It's a mirage
22,5,0,Do you want to borrow our shovel and pail?
25,0,1,This must be Jones.
29,0,0,Relax, you had to leave your scythe at the metal detector. Now, you're just a random guy in a hoodie.
28,2,0,I highly doubt this is the intended use for a litter box.
17,9,1,Ted Cruz is really struggling in New York.
27,2,0,Looking for an oasis.
23,4,1,He told me he was a method cartoonist.
20,6,1,He comes here to relive his greatest accomplishment.
27,2,0,We need to get him to Sandbox Anonymous. Fast.
19,8,2,I love my Pop. He always checks for cat poop first.
22,6,0,I know that crawling out of the desert was a defining moment in his life, but it's our turn!
23,5,0,He wanted to reenact the Jews spending 40 years crossing the desert, but there were budget cuts.
24,2,1,We can play tic-tac-toe on his pants leg, or help him find his contact lens.
22,6,0,We can use it as soon as he gets to the mirage and realizes there's no water.
21,2,4,I think he lost more than his contact lens.
27,1,0,Crawling is not enough! Our true God is going to have to WALK!
22,5,1,He says he couldn't afford a metal detector.
13,11,2,Yeah, but by New York standards, it's immense.
28,1,0,It's only spring.
23,5,0,When they found him, he didn't want to leave.
13,11,3,Should we mention that drinking fountain over there?
18,6,4,Let’s wait; he’s almost there.
24,3,1,He's reliving that desert experience.
23,5,1,Dad just hasn't been the same since Burning Man
20,7,0,We don't want to play deserted island again, Louis.
28,1,0,Too bad those people and buildings are mirages. I've been stuck in this desert for too long!
20,6,1,He's looking for his lump sum distribution
28,1,0,Mmm, Almond Roca
21,5,0,My mom told me it's called 'Performance Art'.
22,5,2,First the neighborhood cats, now him.
19,7,0,My dad says he didn't get into the right pre-K and it was all downhill from there.
23,5,0,I guess burying Dad's bottles in the sandbox completely backfired huh?
20,7,2,His therapist told him to locate his inner child.
25,3,1,He has it flown in from Anguilla, each grain triple carbon-filtered for purity and then infused with hints of fecal matter from the Hudson River.
23,5,0,I heard his wife told him to go pound sand.
24,3,2,He just tore off his nicotine patch and said he'd crawl a mile for a Camel.
19,6,2,Things have gotten really weird ever since Chipotle started offering organic LSD as a topping.
24,2,0,Harley is approaching pit row and will his crew will be priming the treadmill for the swimming portion of the race.
26,2,0,First it was adult coloring books, now adult sandboxes, I am instituting an adult time out!
18,10,1,Mom did say to watch out for any creepy crawlers.
25,2,1,Why do people litter?
28,1,0,Maybe he thinks it is human litter.
20,6,1,See? This is why Trump wants to close the borders.
24,2,0,The delegate selection process is rigged.
22,5,0,When should we tell him it's a mirage?
23,6,0,I guess he misses life in L.A.!
23,4,0,This piece demonstrates how playtime has become a nightmare and should be banned from schools forever.
25,3,1,And then El Lawrence came to the edge of the empty desert, took the elevator down to Apartment 11D, had a beer and took a nap.
22,2,1,"I guess he hasn't found it yet".
22,6,0,Oh, that's just the new gym teacher. He practices his survival skills everyday.
27,1,1,This is just a practice one. We're gonna have the real political revolution later.
24,2,2,Looks like Gregory finally got his Infinite Desert installed.
26,1,2,He's a real stick in the mud
28,1,0,Mr. Neighbor looks thirsty, I wonder how long he's been playing in the make believe dessert?
24,4,0,We know, Dad, we know. You had to trek 20 miles across desert sands to get to school everyday..
17,6,4,I wish he'd think outside the box.
24,4,1,He's in training for a reality show.
22,5,2,Your Dad is kind of a drama queen.
17,8,3,He's training for 'Survivor'.
25,3,0,He recently finished reading ‘Find Yourself in the Desert’, but he will do anything to avoid those annoying baggage fees.
15,8,4,So the sandman is actually real. Go figure.
25,2,1,Every time Mr. Smith ties one on, gets dehydrated and thinks he's in the desert.
25,2,0,Denies global warming has he? This treadmill made of sand should convince him otherwise.
18,7,1,We should tell him the oasis is in the next sand box over.
13,12,2,Mom's right, we need a cover for this thing.
14,9,5,We're going to need a bigger shovel.
24,3,1,My mother does it too, they call it "sand box yoga."
26,3,0,The water just got delivered, Dad. Can we have our turn?
12,12,5,Does not play well with others.
19,5,1,You've heard of quicksand? Well...this is the other kind.
26,3,0,This is the artist's latest performance entitled Election 2016.
22,3,1,He's a sand sculptor and just finishing up his latest masterpiece . He calls it "Desert Floor".
16,9,2,Rough night for the sandman.
18,7,1,That's Lawrence of Suburbia.
24,1,1,If he starts wilting, try showing him more mirages.
26,0,1,He's prepping for the Army desert Survival Course training.
25,3,0,Dad, can we have the sandbox back now?
25,2,0,Mom said the quicksand will cure his delusions of being a Hollywood superstar right away.
23,4,0,Dad takes the fun out of everything.
28,0,1,"Where is your head, now?" John Curliano, Alameda, CA
12,10,5,I like his chances of being rescued.
21,5,0,This may take a while....he says his best marketing ideas come to him in form of a mirage.
19,5,5,Remember the good old days when all we worried about were cats?
20,5,2,No Dad, we don't want to play 'possible effects of climate change' again.
24,5,0,I call 'first dibs' on those snappy shoes.
28,1,0,A Chinese collector wants to buy it for thirty million.
19,6,2,Should we tell him that we found a contact lens there yesterday or just enjoy watching him?
27,1,0,I think he's looking for his pail and shovel.
16,6,5,I don't want a pet cat anymore.
23,2,0,He really believes that play teaches a person how to work.
22,5,1,It's a risk assessment for the co-op's Sahara trek.
24,5,0,He'smaking progress. Last year he would only lie there motionless.
26,0,1,Then dad said, 'But we don't even have a doghouse.'
21,6,0,Spare the rod and spoil the inner child.
16,8,1,Burying your head in our sandbox won't make Trump disappear!
16,11,0,You don't understand performance art. Giving him water will only encourage him.
22,3,3,I'm too young for this crap.
27,0,0,He's been playing in the sandbox way too long.
27,2,0,In an effort to retain top talent, many companies are now offering sandboxes in their break areas. They are a big hit with hipsters facing midlife crises, who take solace and find inspiration while reliving childhood memories.
25,2,1,That's Dan. He's looking for that big green tree.
26,1,0,Can't he just shake a cup with a few coins in it like the other guys do?
22,5,1,Dad fell off the wagon again, he's trying to dry out
14,11,2,I hope he's not a cat person!
23,4,1,He says he is following doctors orders.
16,11,1,Now do you understand why the co-op board banned him from the pool?
18,10,0,He says it's more of an existential thirst.
22,1,1,Should we tell him the oasis is behind him?
24,1,1,My dad's nearsightedness has gotten a lot worse!
18,6,3,It's getting late buddy -- you'd better turn back.
24,2,1,He's trying to develop "Virtual Desert" software but he's having difficulty getting the user interface right.
25,3,0,His mom forgot to pack his juice box.
19,7,2,It was either this or a lap pool.
20,4,2,Mom...can we pleeease get Dad a beer already?
23,4,1,I hate it when The Catman shows up...
18,8,2,Maybe he's an out-of-work archeologist.
26,2,0,I guess we won't need the bucket and shovel, as it's obvious he's just trying to leave his full body imprints in the times of sand.
25,1,2,Humans of New York is nice... In theory
19,4,5,The hard part was figuring out how to keep the sand moving.
15,6,5,He's looking for his offshore account.
23,1,3,To understand "Lawrence of Arabia" you have to understand the sand.
22,3,2,Don't watch; he thinks he's a cat.
22,4,1,Leave him in a bit longer...I think the Sandbox-Detox idea is showing promise.
24,3,1,Talk about a drama queen.
25,3,0,He really misses our Death Valley branch
20,6,3,I wonder if his mom knows where he is?
21,5,3,So much for public art.
26,2,0,Suffering silently is truly a lost art.
26,1,1,Trump supporters.... They can't see beyond the wall.
21,4,2,Thanks to him, I no longer worry about my lack of imagination.
24,3,0,Geez! The big kids get here first and grab all the space!
18,4,4,He calls it "paleo Pilates"
20,7,1,I thought it was your turn to put the cover on the sandbox.
25,3,0,Will you think outside of the box already?
18,6,4,Maybe he'll get the idea if we switch to another brand of litter.
19,7,1,Yep, once we put in the cat litter, he was good to go.
17,6,2,I told him I buried his IPHONE 6 S
19,6,2,I hope the mirage is worth it
26,3,0,He says the last thing he can remember is a cat trying to cover him up.
22,5,1,We may be here awhile - he keeps losing count.
23,4,1,This is exactly why I stopped wearing contact lenses.
24,4,0,He seems a bit lost.
19,4,4,This is still a nicer beach than Atlantic City.
27,2,0,I think he's practicing for the annual "Crawl-a-Thon" race.
25,4,0,No, that's not a mirage. It's an actual coffee shop with WiFi and a public bathroom.
25,2,2,They call him'The Human Cigarette'.
19,7,0,He'd rather die than give us a turn.
22,4,3,He just can't think outside the box.
19,7,0,Your mirage has achieved consciousness.
24,5,0,Don't worry, he won't find the list without a bucket.
22,5,1,If he thinks he's a cat, we will have to play somewhere else.
26,2,0,He's practicing for that stupid audition again.
24,3,1,He's lost without the metal detector.
27,0,0,I thought your brother knew his was the half bath when we invited him
24,2,2,He can't get out of the sand in golf either.
23,3,2,Betcha his Fitbit is confused.
25,3,0,He is planning to audition for the "Lawrence of Arabia' remake.
25,2,0,Frankly, I am not impressed with the Mummy remake.
25,3,0,Miss Miller says he's a performance artist from Arts in the Schools.
18,6,3,I'm not sure that these new public toilets are going to work out.
21,3,2,Crawl Like an Egyptian
26,3,0,Mom says he was stranded on a desert island, so this feels like home.
27,2,0,He said something about 'Speedo season.'
19,6,2,He keeps saying "Wilson!"
21,5,1,DSM-5. Early childhood sandbox deprivation.
27,1,0,My boss told me that I didn't play well in the sandbox with my colleagues.
27,2,0,I call it 'Training for Death Valley Marathon.'
23,2,1,I'm not sure the art world is ready for sand pontillism just yet
25,2,1,It's the latest in artisanal weight-loss programs.
26,2,1,My Dad doesn't believe Mom really got rid of that stray cat.
23,4,2,He's searching for his childhood.
17,9,0,C’mon, Billy. Let’s go play in a virtual sandbox.
22,4,0,We kept one pre-revolution memento.
19,7,0,His hypnotist told him he was a cat.
24,5,0,Mom said his therapist ought to be sued.
23,3,0,You can take the desert out of the desert, but you can't take the nomad out of the nomad.
27,0,1,Suddenly, the boys decided not to share their toys.
24,2,2,Once dad has finished looking for gold nuggets, we can have our turn
21,8,0,Isn't he supposed to be potty trained?
23,4,1,He finally used his one vacation day
25,4,0,My dad's a method actor.
25,3,0,Yeah, it's pretty strange but he says it's equivalent to a run around the park without having to deal with other people.
24,4,1,C'mon Dad its not funny anymore!

22,3,1,He lost his lunch money there long ago and just can't give it up.

24,2,1,We never specified what type of animals could use the litter box.
25,1,1,Be patient. He's been in there for three days now without water and soon will be a goner. Then we can have the sandbox all to ourselves.

22,4,3,It's Uncle Biff's day two on the wagon.
15,11,2,Sorry, but we reserved the sandbox from noon to one.
23,3,2,We could put sand in his pants.
20,4,2,He catastrophizes everything.
20,4,2,Did he just say, 'My kingdom for a horse.' ?
22,4,0,On your way, this isn't the Kalahari.
24,1,0,You want to tell him we weren't playing but only cleaning out the litter box?
17,7,2,It's true! Without his phone he really is lost!
26,3,0,Ah, yes, Oculus Paralysis.
17,9,0,Maybe we should set up the lemonade stand again.
21,4,1,In this sandbox, you tough it out.

17,11,1,Your Dad knows it's just a penny, right?
19,6,1,I guess we harassed the substitute a little too hard.

25,3,0,A man can die in the desert.
26,3,0,Paul. . .Ryan. . .
19,4,3,I hope he buries it when he's done. Wait here while I get a bigger shovel.
