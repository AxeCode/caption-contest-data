17,3,1,After the bird dog, I suppose the dog bird was inevitable.
19,1,2,He went vegan years ago, but he hasn't told his wife.
20,2,0,So a bird on a handgun is worth both of us in this bush?

16,3,2,All he's really saying is give peace a chance.
19,1,0,I love scarecrows with a perch
20,2,0,Now he thinks he's worth two of us.

10,6,5,Teenagers. They think they're invincible.
17,2,2,Neither one of them knows whether he's coming or going.
13,4,2,So that's what you meant by "riding shotgun!"

17,4,0,Watch him spin like a top when Harry does duck quack imitation !
14,7,0,They exchanged tweets and have followed each other ever since.
20,2,0,Shhh! Don't make a chirp; he could be a decoy.

16,4,0,He may be crazy, but I tell you, embedded journalists get all the chicks.
13,7,2,He’s a mockingbird
16,4,2,What a turncoat.
15,6,0,That decoy wouldn't fool even the lamest bird brain.
19,2,0,He didn't make the 74 IQ cut for NRA membership.
17,4,0,She's crazy as a loon.
17,5,0,They negotiated a temporary cessation of hostility.
15,5,1,Do you think it's wise for him to to mock the NRA?
13,4,1,One day it will all backfire on him.
16,5,1,She volunteered to be the neighborhood's early warning system.
12,6,0,The perching market's tighter than we thought.
20,1,0,A duel, again !!??!!
18,1,1,He's one of those "right to be shot" birdbrains.
11,9,2,Looks like the NRA is trying to soften its image!

16,5,1,AND he's tweeting about it. Show-off!
16,0,1,Hope he's got more in that rifle than birdshot.

11,8,2,Oh, to be young and symbiotic.
16,2,1,I can't wait to read his tweet.
19,2,1,That fine line between brave and stupid- does it give you grouse pimples?
19,2,0,That's a shotgun bird if I've ever seen one.
18,3,0,Polly is so brave to tweet out alerts to the other animals!
21,0,0,Do you think that counts as T & E?
18,2,0,He's been coming here for years, never fired a shot. He is not a very good NRA member in my opinion.
17,3,0,I don't have the heart to tell him it's not Bernie
18,1,0,I'm calling it, 'Birdie over Cheney.' Or maybe just, 'Put a Bird on It.'
15,3,1,Leopold is quiet on the details of their arrangement.
16,5,1,It's called a peep sight.
12,5,3,I hope he doesn't tweet his location.
18,5,0,I thought YOU did the stay away from humans training!
11,8,0,Too lazy to fly, always riding shotgun.
14,5,3,Well, he's definitely from your side of the family.

15,6,0,Now that's what I call balls
16,5,1,When he says look at the birdie. Don!t.
17,4,2,He always gets to sit shotgun.
10,4,5,When you think about it, he's actually got the safest seat in the woods.
17,4,0,It's the Big Bang Theory with Twitter.
15,5,0,Like they say, "A bird on the barrel is worth two on a branch.'
16,1,3,Tell me more about Maslow
17,0,1,He must be a left winger? You think!
16,4,1,Sure, he's endangered, but he's also a jerk.
13,7,1,That Sanders rally sure made him cocky.
12,5,5,Did she always take this position on guns?
16,5,1,Talk about a great seat for the wedding.
14,4,1,Don't look now, but your ex is dating another hunter.
18,3,1,Naked is the best disguise.
16,3,1,What's the old saying? A bird on the gun is worth two in the bush.
13,5,0,How does that saying go?
13,6,3,Now are you convinced our son is on drugs?
17,4,0,Over a barrel or out on a limb--which one takes more pluck?
19,1,0,That tweet has flown the coop. He's half-cocked.
20,1,0,Bastard!

15,4,2,He must be in need of a little seed money...
18,3,1,Let's not judge him for going for Trump; we went for Bush.
15,5,2,The new NRA publicists are on to something.
17,2,1,I still say dam that 2nd amendment.
18,1,1,He's a Yellow-Breasted Warner. The idiot with the gun can't hear him, but we can.
19,2,1,Remind me to unfriend her when we get back to the nest.
19,1,0,And humans thought we were stupid...
15,5,1,It looks like Blinky forgot his contacts again.
15,5,1,There goes that guy who always has a chirp on his shoulder.
18,2,2,He has a really high sense of self-worth.
17,1,0,Interesting choice for Rumspringa.

17,1,0,The only way he'll ever use that gun is to pry it from her cold dead claws
14,5,4,He loves riding shotgun.
18,3,1,From the pear tree to the dark side in one swoop...
15,4,3,Gimme a break. He knows the guy's a deer hunter.
20,0,2,He must be looking for wabbits.

14,5,1,They're both bird brains
11,8,1,From the day he was hatched I knew he would be different.
20,1,0,I don't know which one's more stupid.
14,6,1,Ever since he survived that fall out of the nest, he's been a adrenaline junkie!
19,3,1,She needs to stop falling for the first guy who cocks a finger at her.
20,1,2,She's gone to the Dark Side!
14,6,2,'I guess a bird in hand really isn't worth two in the bush.'
16,4,1,Why would he attach that to his gun? I'm gonna go in for a closer look.
18,2,1,Don't believe it. He's a decoy.
17,2,2,Look, the NFL was right to ban this kind of behavior. It's taunting, plain and simple.
15,4,1,Either he's a stool pigeon or a lobbyist for the NRA
16,3,1,He used to work in a coal mine.
20,1,1,Wasn't he at Woodstock?
14,5,3,You just know he's going to tweet about this.
18,4,0,I've never thought of doing that...
20,1,1,Oh crap, a canary.
16,3,0,From what I'm hearing, the old man's a superdelegate.
14,4,3,I think Harold has taken this “Bird in the Hand” thing just a little too far…

21,0,0,please let me know when you find your parents, bebe
19,1,1,He must sure feel that he's a big shot
18,3,0,Don't give me that 'A bird on the gun is worth two--anywhere!'
17,2,1,No, it's a bird in the HAND is worth two in the bush.
15,2,2,If a bird twitters in a forest does anybody @?
21,0,0,What a sell out! I feel so betrayed. This live gun site trend better be a passing fad!
17,4,0,Now I see why they say "position's everything in life".
18,4,0,Personally I think a bird's eye view is over rated.
17,2,0,Son of a gun!
19,2,0,I wonder who won the caption contest

17,3,0,He's got him on his sights
20,0,0,Whew - he's not a strict constructionist.
20,2,0,Would this be considered a bird in hand?
19,1,0,She's at less risk there than we are here. Talk about counterintuitive!
16,6,0,I don't know what she sees in him!
18,3,0,A right wing sparrow? What does he do with the other one?
11,7,1,Didn't I tell you he was a bad egg?
22,0,0,If he could see my Instagram feed right this second he'd go berserk.
14,5,2,Those Bugs Bunny cartoons will be the death of him.
11,9,2,Now mother, we have to let him make his own mistakes.
15,5,1,Keep your friends close and your executioner closest.
17,3,2,He called it.
18,5,0,He just loves messing with them!
17,2,0,There goes Tweety taunting the tourists again.
17,2,2,Two clear cases of A.D.D.
20,1,0,That's really 'getting ahead of the curve!'
19,2,1,So, your Jason got his internship with the ATF then?
12,4,1,It's not even loaded, just an excuse to get out of the house.
12,6,1,Risk taking! That's your side of the family!
17,4,1,Gary was always a plucky lark.
13,7,1,I guess Darwin was wrong on at least two counts.
15,7,0,You've got to admire his beakmanship.
20,0,1,First Bernie gets one, now everybody wants one.
20,1,0,$5 says standing ducks aren't any safer.
16,3,1,I think they are called Coal Mine Canaries.
21,1,0,I don't think this is how the gunfight works
17,3,2,Well, the strange thing is that birds aren't afraid of him but no humans will hunt with him and they say that he used to be some kind of vice president.
17,4,0,So that’s the NRA’s new mascot!
18,3,0,He's engaged to the guy's canary.
20,0,1,He twitted shotgun.
21,0,0,He'll Teewt if danger Smool.

11,8,0,I'm just saying, climate change has reduced the number of perches
13,7,1,I can't wait to tweet about this.
18,2,0,Look, it's a bird's eye view of the NRA
21,1,0,I have a lot of growing up to do
19,1,0,I'd rather have cold feet.
12,4,5,Best he could do after they shot his hippo.
19,3,0,He must have tweeted our location.
20,1,0,It's ok if we keep the eye on the birdie as long as the birdie doesn't keep his eyes on us.
16,3,1,I bet him he wouldn't do it and now I have to pay up. It seems he's got me over a barrel."
16,6,1,Maybe WE should join the N.R.A..

17,1,2,I dared him to do it.
14,2,5,I've heard she's a hunter whisperer.
15,2,4,He'll realize it's not a branch eventually . . . right honey?
13,2,6,Someone really should explain to Larry what "riding shotgun" means.
22,0,0,Isn't that the Bernie Sanders bird?
13,7,1,Perhaps we ought to consider the advantages of helicopter parenting.
15,5,1,Bertie, do you think he knows that we've got him surrounded?
20,0,1,Well, It looks like we can safely remove him from our No Fly Zone
14,4,3,I think he’s about to send his last tweet.
21,1,0,Hipsters will put a bird on anything.
19,2,1,Quisling quail.
19,2,0,Why didn't we think of that, pose as decoy.

16,3,1,I'd tweet him to fly away but I'm over my usage limit.
16,1,1,Looks like the little N.R.A. shoulder patch worked.
20,2,0,He's got his back.
20,2,0,He just watch The Godfather Part II
14,4,2,He's taking his stand on guns a little too far this time.

22,0,0,If he sees usnhensnsupposed to send out a tweet.
19,3,0,Told you it was him - the bird in the hand.
18,4,1,She's telling us old George forgot his glasses again.

15,3,3,So THIS is what Junior means by "riding shotgun"
20,2,0,hey bro
14,5,0,Robin wants to be the poster-bird for the 2nd Amendment

16,4,2,So close, yet so far.
20,0,1,Well, there's one we won't have to worry about.
18,1,3,He's as crazy as a loon....literally.
18,1,1,No worries today, that peep sight is set waaay too far forward!
19,0,1,I'm afraid that Jim has grown tired of seed.
20,1,0,Phase one, complete. Phase two, poke his eyeball out.
19,2,0,They call it a 'shotgun roost.' They're all the rage in New Orleans.
18,2,2,And to think, his great grandfather was the model for the Woodstock logo.
20,0,0,It's a cork gun.
14,4,2,So much for birds of a feather flocking together!
21,1,0,Now we strike back!

15,3,2,who would have thought he was worth two of us
18,4,1,Hiding in plain sight!
12,6,2,It looks dangerous, but it's actually not a bad strategy.
17,4,0,It's a good job...Miriam has his back
12,9,1,He won't be so cocky when bird season opens tomorrow.
14,6,2,He just hasn't been the same since the migration over the NRA convention

18,4,0,We're not safe until it is in his hand.
19,0,0,He sure looks idiomatic!
12,3,4,I'll take truth

14,5,3,Don't you just love deer season.
19,3,0,What time does junior go off duty?
14,5,2,He really committed to hiding in plain sight.
19,1,0,Ever since Bernie Sanders ...
14,7,0,It's tough for a coal mine canary to find work today.
15,3,3,Well that explains the fancy birdhouse and expensive suet.
18,4,0,Not to worry...it's just a presidential candidate looking for a photo-op
17,4,0,I shouldn't have called her an Uber.
18,4,0,Shhh ... be quiet,it looks like a stool pigeon to me.
20,1,0,We always new he was rebellious, but this is ridiculous!
21,0,0,That last tweet must have did him in.
10,6,3,He believes in keeping his enemies closer
14,4,2,He's good looking, but kind of a dodo.
18,2,0,I think his plan is to build a nest out of the mustache.
19,1,0,A real traitor. He tweets when he sees geese
10,7,2,Not exactly a pear tree, is it?
16,4,3,'Keep your friends close and your enemies closer' is one thing. This is just stupid.
14,6,0,They radicalized him, don't tell Mom.
16,2,3,If Larry makes it back, I think next time I'll go with "truth".
17,1,3,I don't think Bill understood when we told him to go where they'd least expect to see you.
14,5,0,Whose the show off riding shotgun
19,1,0,When do you think he'll figure out that he's not at a Bernie Sanders rally!
15,3,1,I guess two in the bush is worth something after all.

18,2,0,Are you going to tweet him or shall I?
12,6,2,I dared him. I didn't think he'd really do it.
22,0,0,"I hope I am not dinner tonight".
11,4,4,I just hope riding shotgun doesn’t backfire on him.
22,0,0,Why does he perch against his own interests?
20,0,0,She's overlooking the most important sight.
19,1,1,A Trump supporter afraid for the future.
17,4,0,Lazy bird, he'll do anything for a free ride.

13,4,3,Everyone says they all go through a rebellious phase...but I'm really starting to worry...
20,2,0,He's watching out to make sure he doesn't kill two birds with one shot!
15,3,2,Trust Ted to land on the safest place in the forest.
19,0,2,Ever since Henderson joined the NRA, he's just been impossible.
15,3,3,I did't think he would take the bet
20,1,0,I can't believe he's really using 1X birdshot.
17,4,0,A bird on the barrel is not worth two birds in the bush.
20,0,1,Oh look Marge, a gun with the safety on, it's called a peeping Tom !
17,2,1,We should be getting a tweet soon.
14,5,1,I keep telling him it's time for contact lenses.
20,0,0,It's not bravery--that guy is a terrible shot.
19,2,0,Welp...fish in a barrel, you're officially on notice.
14,4,2,I knew we couldn't trust him.
19,2,1,Well, you know what they say, you only live once.
19,2,0,Forget the exchange rate, we're not leaving this bush.
16,4,1,Geez, not sure which one of those two is the bigger birdbrain!
18,4,0,Hey, isn't he pledging Sigma Nu?
15,3,2,Uber comes to the jungle.
17,2,0,That still doesn't make you a Cuckoo bird!
15,2,4,He self-identifies as a bloodhound.
14,5,1,Sometimes I wish I was a mocking bird.
11,3,4,He always was a few twigs short of a full nest.
16,4,1,I would have never done that at his age!
19,1,0,I've never been much of a daredevil.
20,0,1,He's worth as much as both of us put together.
17,2,3,It's a decoy.
18,3,1,Hitch hiking can be dangerous.
19,1,1,I'm not sure that's how trigger warnings are supposed to work, but I do feel safer.
14,3,1,He's really a loon!
14,4,4,She's our mole.
20,0,1,I hope his new front gun-sight likes us...
17,3,0,...and we ask yourselves, how in the hell do we keep risking extinction?
18,3,1,Our baby unfortunately joined the NRA.
16,5,0,He's trying the Looney Tunes approach to not getting shot.
21,1,0,"I told you going vegetarian would make him a Democrat".
17,4,0,Something about the statues in this park just doesn't seem right.
10,6,4,Looks like they've got each others' backs.
19,1,0,``Quick! You're being hunted!" ``Who by the hunter?" ``NO! By my husband!"
17,2,0,Do you think hunters fear inner ear problems, and thus, the flaps?
18,3,0,So, this is why he tweeted "pirch'n a smok'n hottie"
19,1,0,It's a peaceful shooting.
14,4,0,He seemed oblivious. Surely a bird on the gun was worth two on a branch.
20,1,0,We dated once, but she's more into the dangerous type.
18,3,1,I'm glad Junior has found a safe place to hide.
21,0,0,...two Turtle Doves And a partridge on a Benelli
16,5,0,Boys are so difficult to raise.
20,1,0,He's not much of a shot.
10,7,4,Well, you did tell him to "keep your friends close and your enemies closer"
14,5,3,There's a good reason why they call them larks.
16,4,1,Something about that tree looks a little off.
14,4,3,So you think he'll talk?
16,3,2,That Sanders bird has gone too far this time
14,6,1,Mark is always looking for the latest adrenaline rush.
15,3,0,He's taking your keep-your-enemies-close advice to an extreme.
19,2,0,If it was me, I'd more than just alit on his rifle.
20,1,0,Don't worry. He's a remaining delegate. Nobody knows where he is, much less what he wants, including himself.
16,3,2,He's on the hunt for whoever sent out that Tweet he didn't like.
14,4,4,Riding shotgun?
15,5,0,That fake Hunter cut out doesn't even fool junior.
20,1,0,To win him over, she tweeted in trump talk.
15,3,2,Teenagers
11,7,0,Now remember, he has to stay there for five steps or I win the bet.
15,4,0,I guess that is the safest place to take a break.
19,0,0,Watch the Birdie
15,2,3,There's no way she's worth the two of us.
13,8,1,Someone should tell him there are no free rides.
18,3,1,Newbie.
22,0,0,Should we tell him that he's on the tip of the rifle?" "He'll figure it out soon enough
16,5,0,Treason is never out of season.
13,7,0,He started off as a bad egg.
21,1,0,A little birdie told me to watch this.....
13,4,2,That proves it. Anyone can join the NRA.
12,4,4,Do YOU want to tell him what "riding shotgun" really means?
16,5,0,I don't care if it is 'Be Kind to Animals Week'. Something tells me not to trust him.
18,3,0,That seems a little more dangerous than just being a bird on a wire.
11,4,5,Yes, but it's that self-destructive personality that makes his songs so memorable.
19,2,1,Junior's balance beam training has paid off, dear.
16,3,1,I warned you not to teach that child to be so trusting.
17,3,0,Don't worry. Today's he 's hunting worms.
17,1,1,I despise him with every feather of my being.
15,4,0,Do you think he thinks that decoy is going to work?
14,6,2,I'll take two in the bush, thank you very much.
14,5,1,Come to think of it, that's a pretty safe place to be.
19,2,1,Looks like Elmer and Tweety had a little spat this morning
18,3,0,He thinks it's a starter pistol
19,1,0,I don't really know, Maude, but that family has always lived on the edge.
13,6,0,I believe our child is turning into an adrenaline junkie.
15,6,1,Keep your friends close...
17,3,1,is that a tweet or a retreat?
16,3,1,Oh that kid of yours, thinks he is a son-of-a-gun
18,1,0,I hope he gives bad advice to the shooter.
22,0,0,Don't worry he vote Republican and the is a dummy.
10,6,2,It's OK. He's a service animal.
15,4,1,Ah, kids these days, huh?
17,4,0,Clearly no flocking together with that one!
12,6,2,It's not clear which is actually the decoy.....
13,4,1,The best defense is a good offense.
10,4,5,Like they say,'Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer'
16,4,0,He was triple-dog dared, so yeah...
16,2,2,The hunter, the hunted, and the haunted…
20,1,0,Looks like _somebody's_ feathers haven't been fluffed in a while.
15,5,1,He's moonlighting as a scope.
16,4,1,She's an endangered species.
18,2,0,That's not Jerry, is it? Actually, yeah. I think that is Jerry.
12,7,1,Our little one...six weeks, and already an activist.
18,0,1,I refuse to be his dinner! When Junior signals 'all clear,' grab his gun and shoot the old foggy dead!
21,1,0,Blue bird on my shoulder makes me happy.
19,1,2,His latest tweet was that he's trying to work within the system.
20,2,0,It's a hunter's twitter.
12,7,2,That's the safest place in the forest.
16,4,2,Well, now he can't grouse about never finding a perch.
14,6,3,That's the worst decoy placement I've ever seen.
16,3,0,Frank has become a real daredevil ever since he accidentally landed on that podium.
20,1,0,Petey always had a death wish.
20,0,0,We're beautifully rendered, sure, but what do we have to do with Donald Trump?
20,0,0,It's a remora bird.
20,0,0,Life's been hard ever since Steve switched sided.
15,3,2,Look at the pecker on that one.
17,4,0,He's got to learn to fly some day.
15,5,0,In a strange way doesn't it remind you of Woodstock?
19,1,1,He just found out Trump had another win.
18,2,1,One of these days that's going to come back to bite him!
21,0,0,At least he doesn't have one stone.
18,0,1,I've got $20 on Fred.
14,3,5,I'm starting to think he's not college material.
14,4,2,That decoy is never going to work.
20,0,1,That probably will work better than our lame camouflage plumage.
17,1,1,Well, it's what you call the cat bird seat.
15,6,1,See? Friends close enemies closer.
14,4,1,Keep watching, he's gonna sit on the guy's hat next!
14,3,2,Don't answer his tweets!
21,1,1,See how safe guns are in the the good ole USA? I told you so!
15,4,1,There's just no respect for traditional imprinting anymore.
13,4,2,Beats voting Republican!
18,3,0,I suppose you could say he has a bird's eye view.
14,7,0,Where have we failed as parents?
17,4,0,Ralphie should know that riding shotgun is not cool.
14,7,0,No wonder bird brains get a bad rap.
14,5,1,Which one do you think is going to be more surprised?
17,5,0,The kid is hitchhiking again.
15,4,1,..and this is a textbook case of natural selection in the wild...
15,5,0,Freeloader!
18,3,0,The nerve, sleeping with the enemy.
20,0,2,I told he was an informant.
18,2,0,He must be related to Bernie Sanders.
17,4,1,Charlie's been like that ever since the Bernie Sanders rally.
18,3,0,Go flock yourself, I wana see how this plays out.
20,1,0,He says, 'it is what it is,' which is totally asinine.
18,2,1,He just retweeted.
20,1,0,I think that's part of the effette wing of the NRA.
19,1,0,She is safe on that perch.
20,2,0,He thinks he's a real bad ass, but pheasant hunting season ended two weeks ago.
15,2,3,Ernie's getting pretty brazen with his support of open carry.

18,2,1,She's picketing
20,0,0,Master, you think you can really shoot down some birds with such ridiculous mechanism?" "I am not afraid of not brave enough to do, but, rather not brave enough to think. Are you, Collaborator, on my side though?
21,1,0,No, I think it's a stool pigeon.
12,5,2,I bet he thinks he's worth two of us.
22,0,0,??Sumer is icumen on, lhookin' fer kukku??
10,6,3,Should we tell him it's not a branch?

17,3,0,Don't be fooled, he's faster than Sundance
18,1,0,Rapproachment?

18,3,1,'There goes the Great Cat Hunter.'
14,5,2,She's one of our embedded journalists...
18,2,1,Elmer Fudsy.
21,0,0,(birds on the tree) You think that man knows?
18,2,1,She's there for comic relief.
16,3,0,How will it end? Hopefully, not with a #bang but a #tweet.
18,1,1,Since coming out his nest egg has grown 200%
17,0,2,See, it's a cardinal sin.
16,2,1,He said it's his Twitter handle."
15,4,1,Sometimes they just have to learn.
15,4,1,These extreme sports are so dangerous

20,0,3,What a cocky little cunt.
14,4,0,Whatever you do, don't retweet.
22,1,0,How many of us is he worth?
21,1,0,I don't know, Maude. We knew he was different when he was in the nest, but somehow I didn't expect him to be THAT different!
21,1,0,This is probably why they always talk about just Two Little Dickie Birds.
15,8,0,Yea! Keep your enemies close.
10,8,3,She thinks the season doesn't open till tomorrow.
17,5,0,That's gotta be worth at least three.
17,3,0,I keep hearing chirps, but there's no birds.
17,4,0,I don't know...it looks like a red herring to me.
16,5,0,That young pheasant is as crazy as a loon!
17,3,1,And they laugh at us for having bird brains...
18,0,2,At least he didn't get into marijuana.
17,2,0,Okay, your affair with that parakeet has its benefits.
18,1,0,Because he loves nature.
13,6,3,You think that's brave do you. Watch me land on his hat.
16,2,2,There aren't any NRA supporters on my side of the family..
23,0,0,The bird on a gun is worth two birds on a limb!
12,7,1,Watching that is a perfect example of why we are the ones called 'mourning' doves.
14,7,0,If you ask me, they're both birdbrains.
17,3,2,She's not to be rifled with.
17,4,0,Facebook & Instagram sure, but I don't think we should Tweet.
14,6,1,I give it six months
19,2,0,She said, "Hi-ho, the derry-o. I'll take a shot to land that farmer in the dell."
13,5,5,I’m not one to interfere with natural selection.

13,6,2,I told you Bob was part Dodo.
18,2,0,Don't fall for it, he's coming for us!
21,1,0,Reason number 951 why people hate pigeons.
17,2,0,I hope he's there to warn us.
17,3,2,When he stops singing, duck!
13,6,2,I always figured he was a right-winger.
17,3,1,So what's a *gun* in the hand worth?
18,0,0,One, maybe two, more solid pecks and "Jackhammer Ralph" should have that front sight misaligned.
19,1,0,Don't worry they'll get him in tax season.
17,1,1,Looks like the NRA wants to appear eco-friendly.
18,3,0,He's new to this game
12,7,1,He's a strange bird.
14,6,2,He'd be a lot safer if he learned how to fly..
20,1,0,She always was a slut!
16,4,1,Now that's foul!
15,5,2,You wanna tell him or should I?
19,1,1,I think she will come to regret relying on the old bird-in-the-hand cliché.
18,3,0,He thought that gunpowder was bird seed.
18,5,0,I don't want to get philosophical, but we're only worth half as much as him.
14,4,4,That crazy kid's riding shotgun again.
19,0,2,That only works here in Arkansas.
16,2,1,That's the old 'bird on the barrel' ploy. We're supposed to think he's bird friendly.
20,3,0,Tweety always did like to live dangerously.
14,7,0,He prefers the backward facing seat in train cars, too.
10,5,6,Brave? You bet... at night he works a second job in the coal mine!
15,4,1,He's a trophy bird, till he poops in the barrel.
19,1,1,Well straight down the barrel is the last place he will look.
12,7,1,Dumbest tweet. Ever.
19,2,1,Rotten stool pigeon.
11,8,3,Yeah, he always has to ride shotgun.
18,3,0,No wonder she finally shut up.
16,4,0,...No , it's still too close for comfort .
17,2,0,He is blinded by the camouflage.
18,2,0,It's a gun, fly away! Haven't u learned anything from watching bambi
16,1,1,It warms your heart to see each generation learn to flash a moon.
16,3,2,That chick has balls.
14,3,1,That decoy is really unbelievable. He isn't going to catch a single human today.
19,0,3,Classic first amendment scenario. The right to be borne on arms.
15,4,2,That hunter's really got game.
11,8,2,He's compensating for a small beak.
21,1,0,Not a friend in need
11,6,4,I'm pretty sure that's a Mockingbird.
20,2,0,The rifle's a bluff. He only hunts for worms.
17,3,0,Duck or he'll start singing like a canary!
18,2,0,Thinks he's safe, but never saw Dick Cheney hunt.
14,4,4,A 'Right-Winger' if I ever saw one.
16,3,2,Well if that isn't a Birds eye-view I don't know what is
17,2,0,It likes guns, so it must be a Bernie Bird.
17,1,1,Where was he when that so called friend of Dick Cheney really needed him?
21,0,0,Steve seems to have come down with a serious case of lemanthrophy
17,3,1,You know, he's lasted this long, maybe he's onto something. Shall we?
18,0,1,Thank goodness for the bluebird of safety.
18,2,1,Tweet, tweet, #dumbassbird
11,6,3,That is living on the edge
15,4,1,Even as a toddler he always like to take chances.
12,3,5,She always rides shotgun.
12,5,4,He's been tweeting about it all morning.
20,2,0,Here comes a barrel roll. Show-off.
16,3,0,Camouflage only takes you so far.
21,1,0,You can see it dripping off of the barrell -- providing yet another meaning for the term bird-shot.
17,4,1,Now that's a bird brain!!
13,5,2,Wow, talk about keeping your friends close and your enemies closer!
13,5,5,A few years in a cage and now he's a stool pigeon.
17,2,1,As all wrens, he likes to brag.
18,2,0,I think our net worth has just been greatly diminished.
17,4,0,I still win unless he craps on his head.
14,6,1,If he gets too close to anybody, she sends out a tweet.
16,5,0,It's the latest wrinkle on eco-tourism.
17,2,2,I hate the way the songbirds get all cocky during hunting season.
22,1,0,Uncle Marty still can't stop looking for the WMDs
20,0,1,You can't tweet something like that.
16,4,1,We should also get floor heating
18,4,0,First the Lion King, and now Elmer Fudd? Man, I just love Broadway live!
17,4,1,I sure hope that counts as 'one in the hand'.
21,1,0,Otto's always been a dare devil!
20,0,1,Not in season show-off!
14,3,2,That bird is really over a barrel.
19,2,0,Watch out. It's a drone.
16,5,0,That's not exactly what I meant when I said to him: 'Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.'
15,5,0,A bird between my sights is worth two in the bush.
12,7,2,"That's why we're called mockingbirds." Submitted by Douglas Monaghan, Floral Park, NY
17,4,0,We are safe, a bird on the barrel is worth two in the bush.
16,4,0,Well that's one way to "flip him the bird."
17,3,1,Look at him. Beak in the air. He thinks he is worth both of us put together.
15,6,0,Poor, nearsighted thing.
15,5,1,Wow, the gun lobby sure has him over a barrel.
15,5,2,Now that's what we call a dodo bird.
9,7,5,Thinks he's gonna be a big shot some day.
15,7,1,He wanted to change the system from within.
17,3,1," It could be a decoy"!
13,4,3,He always liked to be close to the action.
15,3,2,Why am I so attracted to him?
15,5,1,It's always the last place you think to look.
14,4,1,That's a cheep shot, if I ever saw one.
17,3,0,Now that's wht I call the catbird seat!
14,6,0,He's always tweeting about the Second Amendment!
14,6,2,We must teach her to never accept free rides from strangers.

16,5,0,Don't worry! He's on top of it.
15,5,2,He always wanted a mobile home.
21,0,0,I think Birdie has forgotten what socialists look like.
20,2,0,We're safe he's not a serious hunter.
22,0,0,Hers is the best ventriloquism of a bull elk's bugle I have ever heard.
18,4,1,I can't wait to *tweet* this!
10,6,6,Is he loaded?
19,2,1,He's such a self-hating Jay.
19,1,0,I think we don't have to worry much with this one! Check out that hat!!!
12,5,2,It's a changing world, Mildred.
17,2,0,A yellow-bellied stool pigeon, if I'm not mistaken.
13,5,2,I'm definitely taking "TRUTH" next time.
19,2,1,It's called transcendental hunting.
10,6,5,Maybe we deserve to be endangered.
16,1,3,Looks like Elmer has a new twitter follower.
12,4,4,Well, you shouldn't have told him he can ride shotgun.
20,2,0,Come on bro, be a good wingman and distract her friend.
20,1,0,Don't be fooled. Our tiny friend is stuffed.
17,2,3,That's what I'd call 'hunting blind.'
19,2,1,That's his dog-bird
18,3,1,I don't mind his species fluidity. What disturbs me is his support of the NRA.
16,3,2,Junior's new friend worries me.
9,6,4,No wonder they're called mockingbirds.
17,2,0,Don't blame the dove, it's the economy. He hasn't had work since Woodstock.
18,0,0,They met about two years ago and he replaced the gun action with a camera.
20,2,0,That's absolutely brilliant! He found the safest place to be when a bird hunter is on the loose.
14,6,1,Who knew she was a hawk on the Second Amendment?
13,4,3,Riding shotgun again!
19,3,1,Good thing Robin sends out tweets constantly.
13,6,0,Lay low- he's not technically in-hand.
19,2,0,I knew her yellow feathers spelt trouble.
18,2,0,Sometimes you need a better outlook to live a better life.
21,0,1,Got to tweet this to brother Bernie rel quick: NRA found his podium bird!
16,4,0,He's the "little bird that told him".
13,6,2,I thought he wanted to go for a drive when he called shotgun.

20,1,1,A bird on a gun is better than two in a bun.
13,7,0,He must be a mocking bird.
20,1,0,He scared Donald Trump at Rally. He thinks he's invincible now.
20,1,0,Sold out for a year's supply of sunflower hearts!
19,1,0,Spring sighting.
18,3,1,Looks to me like he is just exercising his right to bird arms...
12,6,4,An NRA membership does have its benefits.

19,2,0,If you believe that song he is singing, I have a fence on the Mexican border you can sit on.
21,1,0,Huh. Charlie's not chicken, is he?
19,3,0,He's always looking for an opportunity to exercise his second amendment rights.
17,2,3,Worst production of "To Kill a Mockingbird" ever!
15,5,1,Why do kids insist on doing the exact opposite of what you teach them?
19,2,0,That's one cocky bird-in-hand.

18,0,1,The hunt is rifling my feathers.
19,2,0,as if the dogs weren't bad enough
14,3,2,Worst. Lookout. Ever.
18,1,1,When did Larry turn into a stool pigeon?

11,5,2,Not exactly a bird in hand but I think we might be safe.
11,6,1,He loves to remind us that he's not a game bird.

15,5,1,So, what exactly is that one worth?
13,8,0,They have an understanding.

17,3,0,I sure hope he doesn't kill two birds with one shot!
16,6,1,He's literally riding shotgun.
